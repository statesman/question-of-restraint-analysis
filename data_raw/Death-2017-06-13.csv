This guy told officers straight out he ate crack and they asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital. He kept saying no and they just sort of let him die.,,"On Thursday 09/03/09 at approx. 10:14 pm while on patrol working the 8p-6a shift, I Officer K. Holden assisted Narc. Officer S. Burleigh in making a traffic stop on a subject known to have a suspended drivers license.

Officer Burleigh described the vehicle as a maroon Ford Crown Victoria. Officer Burleigh identified the subject driving the vehicle to me as Payne, Andre Ramon b/m DOB: 10/09/75. Officer Burleigh also advised the subject was heavy set. I observed the suspected maroon Ford Crown Victoria leave the Dayton Cabins located on HWY 90 heading s/b on Hwy 146. I pulled out onto Hwy 146 behind him, but was not close enough to initiate a traffic stop before the vehicle pulled into the Dayton Sports Bar On Hwy 146. 

When I passed the vehicle at the Gas Station I observed a large b/m operating the vehicle. I turned around on Hwy146 and parked in front of Trinity Valley Tractor located on Hwy 146 approx. 200 yards from the Dayton Sports Bar. I was facing north on the east side of Hwy 146 so I could see the vehicle exit the Sports Bar. I informed Officer Burleigh of the vehicles location as he was approaching the Sports Bar himself. Officer Burleigh advised the vehicle was fixing to exit the Sports Bar. Officer Burleigh informed me the vehicle failed to yield the right of way to him exiting the Sports Bar.  I got back onto Hwy 146 heading n/b and approached the suspected vehicle from behind. I observed the
vehicle bearing LP: LYZ-063. I observed the operator of the vehicle to be a b/m and heavy set.

I initiated a traffic stop on the vehicle by activating my overhead emergency lights. The vehicle failed to come to a complete stop by slowly preceding n/b on Hwy 146. I activated my siren and the vehicle came to a stop just north of Woodrow Wilson Juror High.  I exited my patrol unit #61 and approached the vehicle on the passenger side due to the vehicle being parked close to the highway. When I approached the front passenger side window I observed the vehicle to be occupied only by the operator. The operator was a heavy set b/m. I identified my self and the Police Department I worked for. I asked the b/m if his name was Payne and he stated yes. I told Andre that I was informed he was operating this vehicle and he did not have a valid drivers license. While I was talking to Andre he appeared to be nervous. I asked Andre if he did have a drivers license and he said yes. I asked to see the drivers license and Andre retrieved it from his wallet. After Andre handed me his drivers license, I asked him to pull up a little more to get away from the lane of traffic. 

I then asked Andre to step out of the vehicle at which time he did. I asked Andre where he was going and he stated his house located in Baytown. I then asked Andre why he was traveling n/b on Hwy 146 if he was headed to Baytown. Andre stated he was going to take Hwy 90 and go around. I asked Andre where he was coming from and he said the gas station because he was thirst. Andre was referring to the store on Hwy 146. I asked Andre, why didnt he stop at the Race Way gas station across the street from where he was originally at and he stated he has had problems with people in the past at that
location. I asked Andre where he was coming from and he stated he was visiting someone at the Dayton Cabins.
 
I asked Andre if he had any weapons on him and he said no. I asked Andre if I could pat him down and he said yes.  The on duty dispatcher advised Andres drivers license was suspended. Andre stated he had a SR-22 in his wallet and retrieved it. Officer Griffin explained the SR-22 was only good for non-owned vehicles and the one Andre was operating was his wifes vehicle. I placed Andre under arrest for driving while license suspended by placing both hand behind his back, palms out and both cuffs double locked for safety purposes. Andre was handcuffed with leg irons due to his large size. 

I asked Andre if he had anything in his pockets that would poke or cut me and he said no. Incident to arrest I searched Andres pockets before putting him in my patrol unit and transporting him to the Liberty County Jail. In Andres right pocket was a cigarette lighter and two white pills. Andre stated the pills were for weight loss. In Andres left pocket was a plastic cigarette pack holder. I opened the top and observed a cigarette pack containing cigarettes. I pulled the cigarette pack out of the holder and observed off white flakes and residue that appeared to be crack cocaine at the bottom of the plastic holder. I placed everything out of Andres pockets onto the trunk of his vehicle.
 
I read Andres his legal warning and Officer Burleigh questioned Andre about the residue at the bottom of the plastic holder. Officer Burleigh retrieved a field test swab from his vehicle and tested the residue inside the plastic cigarette holder. Officer Burleigh pulled the swab out of the plastic container and showed us it tested positive. I asked Andre if there was anything against the law inside of his vehicle and he said no. Ever time Andre was asked this question he would look toward the vehicle as he answered. 

I placed Andre in the back of my patrol unit behind the front passenger seat. I then rolled down the window on the opposite of were Andre was sitting as Officer Burleigh and myself were inventorying the vehicle. While we were inventorying the vehicle Sgt. Coleman arrived on scene. The wrecker service enroute to the scene was Maine frame. Officer Burleigh placed the evidence into a brown evidence bag and I transported it to the Police Department.
 
Sgt. Coleman advised to place Andre in jail for Driving While License Suspended and take the things that tested positive to the Police Department and place into evidence. Sgt. Coleman advised us Andre ingested a few crack rocks. Sgt. Coleman asked Andre if he wanted to go to the hospital and he said no. I asked Andre if he ingested the crack cocaine before he stopped for me and he said yes. I asked Andre if he ingested a lot and he said no. Officer Burleigh approached Andre and asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital and he again said no. Andre asked if he could have some milk and Sgt. Coleman said yes. Mane Frame Wrecker Service took possession of the vehicle.  

While in route to the Police Department Officer Burleigh stopped and bought Andre some milk. I transported Andre and the evidence to the Police Department for processing. Officer Burleigh met me at the Police Department with the milk. While in the patrol room Andre was very corporative as he was on the traffic stop.

Officer Burleigh unhand cuffed Andre so he could drink his milk. Andre was sitting down in a chair across the desk from officer Burleigh and myself.  While Officer Burleigh questioned Andre about his narcotic activity, Andre started sweating profusely on his head. Officer Burleigh and myself asked Andre multiple times if he wanted to go to the hospital and he said no.

Andre just asked for more milk. Andres response time appeared to be delayed and he was staring at the ceiling. Officer Burleigh told Andre he need to tell us if he took anything else so we could get him help. Andre would not speak because he though the patrol room was equipped with audio and video. Andre then stated that maybe he should go to the hospital. Officer Burleigh called Sgt. Coleman and informed him of the situation. Sgt. Coleman advised to call a Med Unit and unarrest him. The on duty dispatcher toned out a Med Unit at 11:28 pm. Before the Med Unit arrived we told Andre he needed to tell the EMTs what he ingested and how much so they could help him. Officer Burleigh asked Andre how much crack he ingested and Andre held up two fingers on one hand and made a zero with the other hand. Officer Burleigh asked if they were $10 rocks or $20 rocks and Andre nodded his head to the $20 rock. 

The on duty dispatcher called the patrol room and advised Officer Burleigh the med Unit was 30 seconds away. Officer Burleigh suggested all three of us should walk outside the Police Department to met the Med Unit. Andre stood up, grabbed the edge of the desk and started shaking. Andre was also not able to walk. Officer Burleigh and myself helped Andre back into the chair. Officer Burleigh then opened the door so the Med Unit could come inside.

One of the EMTS asked Andre what he took and he would not answer. We informed the Med Unit Andre ingested crack cocaine. The EMT asked Andre how much crack he took and he again did not answer. Officer Burleigh asked the same question right after the EMT and Andre drew the number twenty in the air multiple times. As we helped Andre to the stretcher he set against the side and stated he was going to die and wanted more milk. I then picked up Andres legs and placed them on the stretcher. Andre was secured to the stretcher and placed into the ambulance by the Med Unit, Officer Burleigh and myself. 

The on duty dispatcher called me on the Patrol room phone and asked me if I could ask the med unit where the landing zone was at. I walked out of the patrol room, approached the ambulance and asked the EMTs where the landing zone would be for life flight. The EMTs advised it would be in the Brookshire Brothers parking lot. The EMTs advised they could not answer the radio because Andre had a seizer. I closed the door entered the Police Department and informed the dispatcher of the landing zone.  While at the Police Department Officer Burleigh placed the evidence into the drop box. 

The evidence dropped into the box was the Plastic cigarette holder, 6 clear plastic Baggies found in the vehicle, one dark colored plastic baggie that was approx. 1 inch by 2 inch. And the field-test swab used by Officer Burleigh. I placed the original video tape of the traffic stop in the evidence drop box.",,d,"11,7",,,

Upon arrival, I met with Jail Captain Larry Cook who advised that the inmate was in room #109. I observed that Jailers Vickie Perez and James Collier were present. Chief Deputy Mike Wheat was also present. I was advised that the deceased inmate was an Ernest Lane Muller, W/M, DOB: 05/22/1973. 

I was advised that Justice of the Peace #2 - Randy Vandeventer was enroute to conduct an inquest. I was advised that Muller was brought to jail on October 24, 2009 by Deputy Chad Stewart for a felony warrant that was issued for Motion to Revoke Community Supervision. I was also advised that Muller had a seizure later that same date and was transported to Bayside Hospital by ambulance. Muller was treated and was returned to the jail. 

Once in the entrance of the jail (sallyport) Muller had another seizure and was taken back to the hospital. Again, Muller was treated and returned to the Chambers County Jail. Once at the jail, Muller was placed in hold over #6 so that he could be monitored by the jail staff. On October 26, Muller was observed to have vomited and defecated on himself. Anahuac EMS was called; Muller was decontaminated and transported to Bayside Hospital. While at the emergency room, Muller had to be restrained. I was advised that while Jailer Collier was sitting in the room with Muller, the medical staff entered the room and told Collier to step out into the hallway and that several more medical staff members went into the room. The staff exited the room and advised that Muller was deceased.

Justice of the Peace #2 - Randy Vandeventer arrived and at that time the sheet that was covering the
deceased was removed at which time I was able to start my investigation. Judge Vandeventer obtained his information and ordered an autopsy. Harrisons were called out to transport the deceased to the Jefferson County Medical Examiners Office in Beaumont, Texas.",,d,,,,

Dispatch advised that the disturbance involved a female and a male in black cowboy hat and a gray ford pickup truck. Dispatch advised the truck left and the female was standing in the street with suitcases.

Officer Faulkner and I had just left an alarm at Homebank and were sitting at the intersection of the East Bond Service Road and Malloy. Officer Faulkner went straight on the service road and I turned on Malloy and sat up at 600 Malloy Bridge Road in the Shell Parking lot. The service road is one way at that location and the suspect vehicle would have to pass that location. I saw a gray For F-150 pass and pulled in behind the truck. The truck was occupied by a single male subject wearing a black cowboy hat. I got behind the Ford truck and as it entered the highway at Malloy Bridge Road. I activated my emergency lights. 

The Ford truck continued to travel down the highway and take the Hall St. exit. I continued to follow with the emergency lights going. The truck then turned North onto Hall St. I still continued to follow and activated the air horn on the siren. The driver of the truck kept making furtive gestures towards
the center floor of the truck. The truck then pulled up to Farmers Road and stopped at the stop sign but went straight from the turn only lane. After the truck cleared the intersection of Hall and Farmers, he pulled into the parking lot of Kings Food Market and stopped. The driver was still making the furtive movements towards the center portion of the floor of the truck.
 
The driver opened the truck and at first I ordered him to stay in the truck but the driver was half way out. Since he had partially exited the truck, I ordered him to show his hand and step out of the vehicle. A pat down for weapons was performed for the officer safety. Officer Dickerson arrived on scene and found a stun gun lying in the front seat of the vehicle. At this point I placed the drivers arm behind his back and grabbed his finders to keep the suspect from attempting to flee and placed him at his back of the vehicle. Officers began interviewing the suspect about the disturbance, the furtive movements he was making inside the vehicle and why he didnt stop. 

During the interview the suspect state the female involved as Shannon Floyd. Floyd is known by most
member of the Seagoville Police Department. Officer Dickerson radioed Officer Faulkner and advised him of the other party to the disturbance. I asked the suspect for identification. The suspect handed me a Texas Drivers License with the name Hill, Milton Heath W/M 07-29-1970 Texas Drivers License #(redacted). I performed a warrant check on Hill. While performing the warrant check Officer Faulkner advised that he had made contact with Floyd and she stated there was no assault. The return of Hill came back with a warrant out of Dallas Police Department for Failure to Display Drivers License warrant #C18 127218 02.
 
I had dispatch confirm the warrant with Dallas Police. Hill was placed under arrest. Hill wanted to release his vehicle to another person. I called his sister Gail for him, but got no answer. I then called his brother-in-law but , again no answer. I then informed Officer Dickerson to transport Hill to the station. I then ordered a wrecker for the truck during the inventory of the vehicle; Officer Faulkner found two baggies in the center portion of the floor of the truck. The baggies appeared if they had been pulled open by someones teeth and contained a crystal residue substance believed to methamphetamine. Officer Faulkner immediately brought the bags to me and stated I
believe Hill just ingest some dope. I immediately contact Officer Dickerson and told him to ask Hill if he ingest any dope in the vehicle and to check with him to make sure he doesnt have anything else on him. 

The wrecker arrived the vehicle was impounded by Rickeys Wrecker Service. I cleared the scene and went to the station. Upon arrival at the station, I was informed that Hill had ingest dope and the ambulance was en route. I went out and moved Officer Dickersons vehicle where the ambulance could
have entry into the sally port. The ambulance personal transported Hill to the hospital.
A few minutes later I received a phone call from Gail. Hills sister. Gail stated her sister Cindy was at Parkland and the Ambulance had not arrived. I had the dispatcher check the TLC ambulance to see if they diverted to another hospital. Dispatch stated they went to Baylor Dallas. 

A few minutes later I received another call from Gail wanting to know if anyone was in the truck with Hill. I stated no. Gail then said that Hill had passed away.",,d,11,,,

observed a maroon 2001 Chevrolet Malibu, ND LP # (license # redacted), traveling northbound IH35 E, on the 457 exit ramp (east service road), Hickory Creek, Denton County, Texas. Ainsworth observed the vehicles front license plate to be obstructed. (The license plate could not be read due to damage, possibly from an accident) and he observed the vehicle fail to maintain single lane of traffic. 

(The vehicle drove onto the right shoulder of the road while turning. The driver committed this traffic offense unsafely due to the angle and speed at which he took the right turn). The vehicle then turned left onto the 600 block Denton Drive.

When the vehicle passed by Ainsworth patrol until, Ainsworth observed that the driver appeared to be nervous. The driver had both hands on the steering wheel at 10 oclock and 2 oclock. The driver appeared to have both arms locked out in front of him and was gripping the steering wheel very hard. The driver and passenger would not look at Ainsworths patrol unit.

Ainsworth turned his patrol unit around and pursued after the vehicle. The vehicle failed to signal 100 feet before turn as he turned left into the parking lot of D&J Convenience Store (633 S. Denton Dr., Lake Dallas, Denton County, Texas). As the vehicle turned into the parking lot, Ainsworth activated his emergency lights and initiated a traffic stop. The vehicle stopped in front of the convenience store. 

(Due to the driver of the vehicles actions at the moment he was pulled over, Ainsworth did not check out on traffic at that time. Ainsworth had to quickly exit his vehicle to approach the driver.)

Ainsworth immediately observed the driver of the vehicle make furtive movements toward the center console area of the vehicle. Ainsworth exited his patrol unit and approached the driver of the vehicle. As Ainsworth was approaching the driver side of the vehicle, the driver opened the door. Ainsworth asked the driver for his drivers license and insurance. The driver was identified as Ivy, Joshua Carl W/M 02/08/1982. 

(While Ivy was talking, Ainsworth observed Ivy to be talking at a fast pace.) Upon retrieving the drivers license and insurance, Ainsworth started to advise Ivy why he was pulled over. When Ainsworth mentioned the front license plate to Ivy, Ivy quickly exited the vehicle and tried to walk around to the front of his car.

Ainsworth advised Ivy to stop. Ivy quickly placed his hands above his head. Ainsworth advised Ivy to sit back down in his vehicle. Ivy sat back down, in the driver seat. (Ainsworth observed both Ivy and the passenger to be extremely nervous, jumpy and shaking as they moved. Both Ivy and the passenger stuttered and changed pitches as they spoke.)

While Ainsworth was speaking with Ivy and his passenger, Ainsworth observed Ivy to be opening and closing the blade of a pocket knife in his right hand. (Ainsworth observed several pocket knives in the driver door compartment, center console area and Ivys left pocket. Ainsworth advised Ivy to place the knife he was holding on the floorboard. Ivy then placed the knife on the floorboard. When Ainsworth asked the passenger for his identification, the passenger stated it was in the trunk. The passenger then tried to exit the vehicle.

Ainsworth told the passenger to stay in the vehicle. Ainsworth then advised Ivy to stay seated in his vehicle, shut the door and stay in the vehicle where it was air conditioned. Ainsworth then walked back to his patrol unit, checked out on traffic and requested a second unit to assist. (While waiting for Corporal Anderson to arrive on scene, Ainsworth observed Ivy and the passenger
to make several furtive movements toward the center console area of the vehicle. Ainsworth also observed Ivy slump back in his seat for a moment and then lean forward make more furtive movements toward the center console and floor-board area of the vehicle.) Anderson arrived on scene to assist.

(Due to Ivys actions, Ainsworth believed that Ivy was intoxicated from an illegal drug.)

Ainsworth walked back to Ivys door and observed, what appeared to be, Ivy sorting his CDs in a CD case. Ainsworth had Ivy exit the vehicle. Ivy picked up a partially opened can of soda and placed it on the roof of his vehicle. Ivy then placed his hands in the above his head when Ainsworth advised Ivy to place his hands on his vehicle.

 Ivy then placed his hands on his vehicle. (At this time, Anderson had the passenger exit the vehicle.
The passenger was identified as Flynn, James Joseph W/M 03/23/1965.) While patting Ivy for weapons, Ainsworth located a pocket knife in Ivys front left pocket and a pocket knife in his front right pocket.

While Anderson was patting Flynn for weapons, Anderson located a syringe in one of Flynns pockets.
Anderson then motioned for Ainsworth to place Ivy in handcuffs. Ainsworth secured Ivy in double-locked handcuffs. Ainsworth asked Ivy if there was any other syringes, drugs or paraphernalia in his vehicle. Ivy motioned toward the back seat and stated there were two more syringes. Ainsworth had Ivy stand at the rear of his Ivys vehicle. Ainsworth walked back up to the driver door and opened the door. 

Ainsworth immediately observed a glass bulb pipe with suspected methamphetamine residue inside. Ainsworth walked back to Ivy and advised Ivy that he was under arrest. Ivy was placed in the back seat of Ainsworths patrol unit and Flynn was placed in the back seat of Andersons patrol unit. (Ainsworth turned the AC to max AC and made the air as cold as it would get. Ainsworth then faced the vent to the opening in the prisoner divider.)

(Anderson also located a Texas Drivers License for Miller, Clayton Heath W/M 11/02/1975 in Flynns pocket, next to Flynns credit card. Flynn cold not explain why he had the drivers license. Anderson also located check #1316 between the front passenger seat and the center console, made out to Clayton Miller.)

Ainsworth and Anderson then searched Ivys vehicle. Ainsworth seized the following evidence from Ivys vehicle:

1. Glass bulb pipe with suspected methamphetamine residue inside. (Inside the driver door, side
compartment.

2. Black and grey cloth bag containing a black AWS scale, model #AMW-550 with white reside inside. (From back driver side floor-board.)

3. Plastic bag containing 9 unused syringes. (From the front passenger area of the vehicle).

4. Metal spoon with suspected methamphetamine residue on it. (From an orange and black back pack in the trunk of the vehicle.)

5. Used orange and white syringe. (Was next to the spoon in the orange and black back pack in the trunk of the vehicle.)

All evidence was placed in a clear zip-lock bag and was placed in the front passenger floor-board of
Ainsworths patrol unit. After completing the search of the vehicle, Anderson inventoried and impounded the vehicle. Ainsworth moved Flynn to Ainsworth patrol unit. Both Ivy and Flynn were advised they were under arrest for Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. Ainsworth then advised Denton County Dispatch (DCSO) that he was in route to DCSO jail with the two arrested persons. Anderson remained on scene and released the vehicle to the on-call wrecker, Pro Tow.

As Ainsworth entered the interstate from the east service road, Ainsworth observed Ivy to be squirming around. Ainsworth asked Ivy if he was alright. Ivy stated he was ok. Ainsworth then observed Ivy to strike the window barrier with his head. 

Ainsworth asked Ivy if he needed to go to the hospital several times. Ivy stated he was alright. Ainsworth asked Ivy if he was sure, in which Ivy replied, Yeah, Im good. (Ainsworth set the
camera to where it was facing Ivy.)

Ainsworth observed Ivy to rapidly shake his head from side to side and stiffen out his neck. Ivy continuously kicked the bottom of the window barrier and straightened out his legs, to where he was no longer in the seated position. Ainsworth called Anderson and advised him what Ivy was doing. Ainsworth advised Anderson that he thought Ivy could possibly be falsifying his actions because he was arrested. 

(Ivy did not start moving around like he was until he was approximately 1 mile away from the location of the traffic stop.) Anderson stated to continue to DCSO jail.

(While calling Anderson, Ainsworth again asked Ivy if he needed to go to the hospital. Ivy did not respond to Ainsworth.)

Ainsworth contacted DCSO dispatch and advised them to have additional officers waiting due to Ivys actions. Ainsworth asked Ivy several more times if he needed to go to the hospital. Ivy did not reply yes or no; Ivy, instead, replied with other words and phrases that did not make sense. Ainsworth could not understand Ivy most of the time he talked. (Ivys speech became faster and more incoherent.) 

Ainsworth advised Ivy that he would have medical look at him when he arrived at the jail. Ainsworth then contacted dispatch again, and advised them to have medical on standby. Ainsworth advised dispatch that Ivy was possibly intoxicated on illegal drugs.

Upon arrival at the jail, DCSO jailers escorted Ivy from patrol unit to the safety area for a search. While the jailers attempted to search Ivy, he physically resisted them. The jailers then secured Ivy against the wall for officer safety. (It appeared the jailers were holding Ivy against the wall to keep him from causing harm to himself or others.) Ainsworth heard a jailer yell, Stop resisting, stop resisting.
Ainsworth continued to search the back seat of his patrol unit, in case either Ivy or Flynn left any property in the back seat. When Ainsworth was finished searching, he observed the jailers gently assisting Ivy to the floor.

DCSO medical staff was with Ivy at this point. Medical placed an oxygen mask on Ivy. Ainsworth called for EMS at 1258. Denton EMS arrived on scene approximately six to seven minutes later. (Ainsworth heard someone state that Ivy was having multiple seizures.)

Denton EMS personnel then placed Ivy on a gurney and transported him to their EMS unit. Ainsworth advised EMS personnel that Ivy was being released to them due to his medical condition. Ainsworth also advised EMS personnel, that due to the criminal offense being a class C Misdemeanor, Ainsworth would just file at large on Ivy. Ivy was released to EMS personnel.
While EMS personnel were providing medical assistance to Ivy, Ainsworth heard one of them state he had died and they were doing CPR. Ivy was then transported to Denton Regional Medical Center (DRMC). Ivy was pronounced dead at DRMC.

While Ainsworth was working on the booking paperwork for Flynn, Sergeant Starnes called Ainsworth and advised him to transport Flynn to HCPD. After Ainsworth checked out at HCPD with Flynn, Starnes spoke with Flynn. Flynn completed a voluntary statement, was issued Citation #49229 for Possession of Drug Paraphernalia, and was released.",,,,,,

Wahl (Unit 12D42B), C. Ortiz (Unit 12D22B) and Sergeant Countie (Unit 12D07E) were dispatched to 16014 Stonehaven in reference to an assault-injury call. 

Prior to arriving at the originating scene, Sgt. Countie located and detained the decedent, Sam Akin, in the 4400 block of Brookgreen as the decedent was trying to leave the area.

Sgt. Countie and Officer Wahl then went to the originating call location 16014 Stonehaven with the decedent detained. They conducted an interview of the complainants and the decedent at the scene. They learned that the decedent is the father and husband of the two complainants and he had choked them during a violent struggle. The officers called for the Houston Fire Department (HFD) to make the scene to treat minor injuries of everyone involved. 

There was no report of the decedent resisting or struggling with the officers at any time. As
HFD left the scene, officer Wahl contacted Assistant Harris County District Attorney Baker, who accepted the charge of Class A Assault against the decedent. The decedent was placed in handcuffs in the back seat of Office Ortegas patrol car for transport to a jail facility. 

As Officer Ortega prepared to transport the decedent from the scene to the jail, he began to complain of difficulty breathing. Officer Ortega immediately ceased his transport and called for HFD to return to the scene.

HFD personnel returned to the scene and transported the decedent to Clear Lake Regional Hospital
Emergency Room. The decedent was admitted into the hospital on August 26, 2008 at 12:46 am and was subsequently connected to a breathing machine.

Officers from the Clear Lake Patrol Division kept guard of the decedent while he was at the hospital. On August 27, 2008, Officer Rimmer (Unit 12D70D) obtained permission from HPD Homicide Division to obtain an Assault Warrant on the decedent in order to release their detention of him. At this time, the decedent was paralyzed on his entire left side after suffering a stroke. He was on a breathing machine and would require extensive medical treatment.

Hobbs #6111 initiated a traffic stop on a black 2004 Ford F-150 in the driveway of 1218 South Medora Street. Sergeant Hobbs initiated the stop after he noticed the vehicle was operating on a public roadway with a defective license plate light. 

Sergeant Hobbs identified the driver as Timothy Wayne Hodges. The passengers in the vehicle were identified as Freddy Patrick Muambila and Christopher Chadd Irwin. Hobbs described all three occupants as appearing to be extremely nervous.  Sergeant Hobbs suspected these subjects were attempting to purchase or had already purchased illegal narcotics. The subjects were unable to provide a viable explanation for why they had pulled into the driveway, and the homeowner confirmed he did not know any of the subjects. Hodges and Irwin were not from Terrell.

Hodges gave Sergeant Hobbs permission to search the truck, being the owner and operator, and all of the occupants were removed.  Sergeant Hobbs received notification that Muambila and Irwin had traffic warrants out for their arrest so he placed the two of them into custody. Those warrants were confirmed. Sergeant Hobbs searched the vehicle and located a small leopard print cloth type case containing a white crystal type substance believed to be methamphetamines. Hodges was arrested and booked into the Terrell City Jail on the charge of possession of a controlled substance. 

Muambila and Irwin were arrested and booked into the Terrell Jail on their outstanding
warrants. Irwin arrived at the jail at approximately 11:55 pm, placed in a holding cell and appeared in normal health. He did not complain of any illness. Irwin was placed in a cell at 00:53 am, to allow him access to a toilet, and monitored by video. Muambila was placed in the cell with Irwin and they were advised if they needed anything to notify CSO Jansen. 

Between the hours of 0024 and 0143 seven person-to-person contacts were made with Mr. Irwin by three separate Staff Members. During these seven person-to-person contacts, staff members inquired 13 times about either the cause of Irwins illness or his condition. Additionally, during these same 13 inquiries Staff Members twice asked Mr. Irwin if he needed medical assistance, which he refused. Two staff members also conducted periodic monitoring of Irwin via video (at least twice) between the person-to-person contacts. Irwin was asked twice at 00:38 if he wanted EMS and he declined treatment. Another time he was asked if he needed anything, but EMS was not specifically mentioned and during those contacts he did not request any medical treatment. At 00:54 am, Irwin advised staff that he had eaten bad oysters and taken Pepto Bismol. 

At 00:59 am, Sgt. Hobbs was notified of Irwins condition by CSO Jansen. Jansen advised Hobbs that Irwin said he is just sick and is denying he swallowed anything. At approximately 1:43 (eighth check) CSO Jansen observed that Irwin was shaking and sweating profusely. CSO Jansen advised Irwin he was going to call for emergency medical personnel and Irwin agreed to EMS examination at this time. Irwin was in the presence of either Muambila or Hodges when his illness was discussed and they did
not mention anything about him swallowing drugs even though they had that knowledge. The jail staff
requested the response of emergency medical personnel who arrived at 1:51 am, and began transporting Irwin at approximately 2:10 am to the Texas Regional Medical Center in Sunnyvale, Texas. 

At 1:59 Irwin admitted to eating drugs, but would not say what it was that he ingested. Irwin was becoming agitated in his actions and was trying to pull/force open the holding cell door, so EMS personnel requested Irwin be restrained for transport. Irwin was placed in a transport belt with his hands secured in handcuffs in front of him to allow for medical treatment. During the transport to the medical facility, Irwin continuously pulled against the handcuffs.

Despite this, no other form of restraining was required during the transport. A police officer followed in a marked police unit for additional safety and in case the cuffs needed to be immediately removed. A paramedic was also given a handcuff key, during the transport, in case of an emergency. Irwin arrived at the hospital emergency room at 2:35 am. After medical efforts, Irwin was pronounced deceased by Dr. Han at Texas Regional Medical Center at 11:35 am on Thursday, June 9, 2011.

After interviewing Hodges and Muambila, it was determined Irwin ingested a baggie containing approximately 3 grams of methamphetamines, without police knowledge, during the initial stages of Sergeant Hobbs traffic stop. Irwin ingested the methamphetamines to prevent police from detecting this substance. During the entire time Irwin was showing signs of becoming ill, as well as during the entire time jail and police staff were questioning Irwin about his illness, both Muambila and Hodges were present. At no time did Hodges or Muambila volunteer information to staff regarding Irwin ingesting a large quantity of drugs. Irwins autopsy was performed by Dr. Chester Gwin at the Southwest Institute of Forensic Science and the results are pending.",,d,11,,,

BROWN was yelling out unintelligible sounds. 

An ambulance was immediately summoned for BROWN by the officers. The officers believed BROWN had overdosed on PCP due to his erratic behavior and demeanor. The officer elected to handcuff BROWN, behind his back, not only for his own safety but for officer safety as well.

I am employed by the Aldine Independent School District Police Department as a police officer. On 02/08/2014 I was working off duty security at Wal-Mart at 10411 North Freeway, Houston, Texas. I was wearing my regular police uniform and was working from 12pm to 12am. At approximately 1545 hours I was standing near the pharmacy exit talking to Zane Mariscal (Wal-Mart co-manager). Mr. Mariscal pointed at a white male wearing a blue shirt and blue jeans and stated he is sniffing. The white male was standing in the checkout line of register #24. 

I walked towards the white male and observed that he was holding three canisters of compressed air, like the type used to clean a keyboard, and was discharging the air and inhaling it. I am familiar with persons using the canned air to get high and that it is a violation of the Health and Safety Code. I approached the white male and asked him what he was doing. He responded that he was sniffing. The males eyes were red, bulging, and his face was red. I noticed he had mucous on the right side of
his shirt and he appeared intoxicated. He was unsteady on his feet.

I took the canisters from him and handed them to Mr. Mariscal and advised the male to put his hands behind his back. The male complied and I secured his hands with handcuffs. I searched the male and located a set of keys and a debit card. The debit card was issued to Stephen Allen. The male advised his name was Allen. I walked the male, accompanied by Mr. Marisal, to the loss prevention office. The male walked with me without difficulty. 

On the way to the loss prevention office I was contacted by loss prevention and advised that they had another male shoplifter that was not complying with their requests to come to the office. I escorted the male into the office and asked him to sit on a bench in the office and he complied. Nalisha LNU (loss prevention) entered the room when I did and I asked her to watch the male while I left to assist the other loss prevention officer, Joe Escamilla. I then exited the office and met Joe by the exit doors, just outside the loss prevention office. Joe identified a Hispanic male as the shoplifter he was having problems with. Joe advised the Hispanic male had stolen some razor blades and he (Joe) was holding an open package of razor blades. I searched the male and located some additional razor blades in his pocket. I then walked the Hispanic male to the loss prevention Office. I secured him in handcuffs and asked him to sit on the bench with the other male. I advised Nalisha to contact HCSO to respond for the suspects. 

I advised the suspects to provide their information to the Wal-Mart prevention employees. Joe and Nalisha were typing their reports and I was sitting in a chair against the wall. Allen asked to take a piss and I told him he would have to wait on the Sheriffs Office. After about 10  15 minutes I observed Allen slumped over to the side and his eyes were open and rolled upwards. I approached him and asked him if he was okay and I shook him. He did not respond. I uncuffed him and placed him on the floor. He was not breathing and had no pulse. I started CPR and said call 911 and asked for a defibrillator. I kept doing chest compressions until EMS arrived and took over. Allen was transported by EMS.",,d,,,,

Officers J. Padron, W. Hunt, and Sgt. E. Godwin responded to the call. Upon arrival, officer located Greg Cranfill (D.O.B. 11/10/65). G. Cranfill was uncooperative with officers and had to be assisted to keep from falling. The ambient temperature was approximately 35 to 40 degrees and G. Cranfill
was cold and shivering. G. Cranfill was handcuffed using proper technique and placed in the back seat of a marked patrol vehicle to warm up while being detained for investigation of public intoxication. 

During the course of the investigation, G. Cranfill attempted to get out of the patrol vehicle. At that time his legs and knees began to buckle and G. Cranfill was seated back inside the patrol vehicle. Officer learned that G. Cranfill had been stopped earlier that evening and may have ingested a quantity of unknown narcotics. Officers became increasingly concerned about G. Cranfills health and well-being due to his ever deteriorating condition. 

Sgt. E. Godwin requested that an ambulance/EMT be called to the scene to evaluate G. Cranfills condition. Officers asked G. Cranfill if he had taken, used or ingested anything that would cause him harm. Officers also asked if G. Cranfill had a medical condition, including diabetes that the officers and/or medical personnel should be concerned about. G. Cranfill was uncooperative and replied negatively. While waiting on the ambulance, G. Cranfill began to lose consciousness and slide down in the seat. Sgt. E. Godwin observed that G. Cranfills eyes became fixed and unblinking. Sgt. E. Godwin also observed that G. Cranfills pupil were abnormally large.

Sgt. E. Godwin checked G. Cranfill for a pulse, finding none. G. Cranfill was removed from the vehicle, the handcuffs were removed and CPR was begun by on-scene officers. After one cycle of compressions and breaths were completed, G. Cranfill took a breath and had a brief pulse. This stopped almost immediately.

CPR was continued until San Angelo fire Department ambulance/EMTs arrived and took over the medical response. The ambulance transported G. Cranfill to the nearest medical facility, Shannon Medical Center, for emergency treatment. Upon arrival as Shannon Medical Center emergency room personnel continued emergency treatment but were ultimately unsuccessful in reviving G. Cranfill. G. Cranfill was pronounced deceased at 0312 hours.

Detectives and crime scene personnel from the San Angelo Police Department were notified as was the chain of command. Due to the sensitivity of the incident, the investigation was turned over to the Texas Rangers.

Ranger Nick Hanna assumed the lead position in the investigation, assisted by SAPD detectives and crimes scene personnel.

G. Cranfills body was taken to Lubbock County Medical Center for autopsy. During the autopsy, Medical Examiners observed fresh needle marks on G. Cranfills arms, consistent with recent and prolonged intravenous drug use. Medical Examiners also located a small plastic bag containing a white powder like substance within the contents of G. Cranfills stomach. The substance was suspected to be cocaine or methamphetamine. The bag was ruptured which ultimately caused an accidental overdose which resulted in the death of G. Cranfill. 

Toxicology results are currently pending that will determine the identity of the substance. The remainder of the investigation is currently undergoing.",,,,,,

When the detention guards went to check on the deceased he was located on the floor near the restroom stall. The deceased appeared to be having a seizure and was foaming at the mouth. Detention guards called for the medical staff and for EMS. Once EMS arrived they worked on the deceased and moved him into an ambulance where they continued to work on him. The deceased passed away in the ambulance.",,,,,,

Marijuana (< 2oz.) by the Hartley County Sheriffs Office. The arrest occurred as a result of a traffic stop in which LUCERO was the right front passenger. 

The traffic stop/arrest occurred .1 mile north of the intersection of FM 767 and FM 2357 on FM 2357. The driver of the suspect vehicle was identified as Monica Fay HAALAND, W/F, DOB 11-25-1969, who was also arrested for Possession of Marijuana (< 2 oz.). During said traffic stop, LUCERO admitted to Hartley County Deputy Chanze FOWLER to having marijuana in his (LUCERO) possession. 

At approximately 4:09 p.m., Deputy FOWLER arrested/handcuffed LUCERO (hands secured behind back) and secured LUCERO in the right front passenger seat of Deputy FOWLERs patrol unit
(Chevrolet Tahoe). Hartley County Deputy Randy HOOKS had previously arrived and was maintaining visual contact on LUCERO and HAALAND. At approximately 4:26 p.m., Deputy HOOKS observed what he believed as LUCERO trying to escape from the handcuffs. 

Deputies HOOKS and FOWLER contact LUCERO, who is complaining about the handcuffs hurting his hands. Deputies noticed LUCERO sweating profusely and skin being clammy. Deputies believed LUCERO had possibly ingested some type of narcotics, namely: methamphetamine. 

Deputies removed the handcuffs from LUCERO and re-handcuffed LUCEROs hands in front. At approximately 4:28 pm, Deputies requested an ambulance for LUCERO. While awaiting the arrival of
an ambulance, Deputies asked LUCERO numerous times if he (LUCERO) had ingested any narcotics, which LUCERO denied. Deputies continually attempted to speak with LUCERO, who was becoming lethargic, but advised he (LUCERO) was alright and continued denying he had ingested any narcotics. 

At approximately 4:45 pm, Hartley County EMS arrived and began treating LUCERO, which lead to EMS performing CPR on LUCERO. At approximately 4:59 pm, EMS transported LUCERO to Channing, Texas, where Lifestar aerially transported LUCERO to Northwest Texas Hospital in Amarillo, Texas, where LUCERO was placed on life-support until his death on 3-14-2007, at approximately 1:10 p.m. LUCERO was pronounced dead by Potter County Justice of the Peace Thomas JONES.

Mr. Bell subsequently began having seizures and was transported by ambulance to Charlton Methodist Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Incident Taken from Officer Huertas statement.

On 09/09/06 at around 0100 hours Officer C. Huerta 203 observed a blue Lincoln Town car, license plate (redacted), traveling south bound in the 500 block of N. Hampton with a head light out. The Town car then made a right hand turn onto the 100 block of Barrows Place, a dead end street. Officer Huerta initiated a traffic stop in front of 104 Barrows Place.

Officer Huerta then made contact with the driver and sole occupant Antonie D. Bell. Mr. Bell Advised Officer Huerta that he did not have his license or insurance with him. Officer Seif #409, who had arrived as a cover officer, was on the passenger side of Mr. Bells vehicle while Officer Huerta was on the drivers side of the vehicle talking to the still seated Mr. Bell. As Officer Huerta was walking back to his vehicle Officer Seif informed Officer Huerta that he had observed a small can of Bud Light sitting in the center console of the suspects vehicle. Officer Huerta went over to the passenger side and asked Mr. Bell to hand him the beer.

Mr. Bell then picked up the can and poured out the entire can of beer on the floor board of the his vehicle. Mr. Bell then gave the empty can to Officer Huerta at which time Officer Huerta noticed that the can was still cold. Officer Seif then had the suspect step out of the vehicle and patted him down. Officer Huerta watched the suspect as Officer Seif searched the vehicle. Officer Huerta obtained Mr. Bells name and date of birth and ran him through TCIC/NCIC. Dispatch stated all they could find was a suspended I.D. card for Mr. Bell. 

Once Officer Seif finished his search of the vehicle, Officer Huerta placed the suspect under arrest for No Driver's License and No Insurance on the vehicle. Mr. Bell was searched by Officer Huerta before he was placed in the squad car. The suspect had no kind of picture identification on his person and could not be positively identified without taking him to jail.

Officer Huerta called 24 Hour Wrecker to impound Mr. Bell's vehicle. Officer Huerta then transported Mr. Bell to the front parking lot of the police department. Officer Huerta parked his patrol unit in front of the P.D. so that he could do his arrest paper work via in car computer. The suspect was coherent and gave Officer Huerta all the needed information for the tickets and arrest report. While Officer Huerta was completing the arrest paper work he heard a thump in the back seat. It sounded like the suspect may have hit the bottom of the squad car's cage with something. Officer Huerta then looked back at Mr. Bell and observed that he was lying down in the back seat. 

Officer Huerta asked Mr. Bell if he was okay. Mr. Bell rose up and Officer Huerta observed that he
had a small amount of blood on his lips. Initially Officer Huerta thought that Mr. Bell had hit his mouth on the cage and was starting to act belligerent. Officer Huerta then started to drive Mr. Bell to the back of the Police Department into the sally port to take him inside the jail. Mr. Bell at this point stated something about coming and getting it, or stated something about swallowing a large amount of dope. 

Officer Huerta doesn't recall exactly what was said by suspect. Officer Huerta stopped his vehicle, exited, and went to the back where Mr. Bell was. Officer Huerta observed that Mr. Bell was lying on his back with blood coming from his mouth and appeared to be having convulsions. Officer Huerta got Mr. Bell out of the vehicle and asked him what was wrong. Mr. Bell stated that he swallowed 1/4 ounce of cocaine and to get him a paramedic or he was going to die. 

Mr. Bell was, according to Officer Huerta, out of control and appeared to be in a panic state. Mr. Bell tried to run into the street in front of the police department. Officer Huerta with the aid of his civilian rider restrained Mr. Bell to keep him from running away and to keep him from hurting himself. During this, Officer Huerta called for a paramedic unit and advised Dispatch that the suspect stated he swallowed a quarter ounce of dope.

Officers then held the suspect up to keep him from injuring himself, and so that he could get some air. The suspect was still breathing but went incoherent and did not respond to the Officers. The medics arrived on scene and Officers Huerta and Allstot rode with them to the hospital. Mr. Bell was later pronounced dead at or about 0315 hours",,,,,,

IH 20.
I arrived in the area of Wal-Mart at approximately 1734 hrs when I saw a group of Wal-Mart employees pushing a cart filled with items back from the southwest corner of the parking lot past Murphys Gas and Oil.

A few of the employees pointed to the west and yelled to me that other Wal-Mart employees were chasing the suspect on foot in a field west of the Wal-Mart parking lot. I drove to the field that was pointed out to me. I saw a white male in a blue shirt pointing into a heavily treed
area and yelling.

I drove further to Cinema Drive and pulled onto the side of the road. I saw a white male in what appeared to be a white short sleeve shirt and blue jeans running in the thick brush.

I exited my marked Hudson Oaks Patrol Car #15 and started a foot pursuit of the suspect. The white male ran from me and went into the brush. The brush was very thick with trees and thorns. I ran after the white male and lost sight of him. I came to a ravine that had a clearing and again spotted the white male suspect. There was no way to cross the ravine except by jumping over it. The white male suspect was on the other side of the ravine. I saw the white male start to bend over and grab at his pants. 

I pulled my department issued Glock .40 and pointed it at the suspect and yelled for him not to move and that I was an armed police officer. I saw the man in the blue shirt back off as Officer Hicks arrived on scene. Officer Hicks pulled his taser and pointed it at the suspect. Both Officer Hicks and I gave verbal commands to the suspect to stop and put his hands on top of his head. At first the white male suspect did not comply. Officer Hicks advised the suspect that if he did not comply we would use force. Cpl. Clark advised the suspect to turn around and place his hands on his head. The suspect complied with Cpl. Clarks commands.

I holstered my duty weapon.

I climbed out of the ravine and saw Cpl. Clark placing handcuffs on the suspect. I helped escort the suspect to the patrol cars which were parked approximately 30 yards away.

The suspect was breathing heavy and walking slowly. The suspect stated that he was short of breath. The suspect's legs buckled and he slowly started to fall. Sgt. Carmichael (of the Willow Park Police Department) and I helped the suspect back to his feet. The suspect stated that he did not feel like walking. Cpl. Clark went to get his patrol car to see if he could pull it closer. Because of the terrain it did not seem that Cpl. Clark could get his vehicle down to us. Sgt. Carmichael and I helped the suspect walk approximately 25 yards toward the patrol vehicles.

The suspect again fell to the ground.

At this time Cpl. Clark assisted me in lifting the suspect back to his feet. The suspects legs buckled again and he fell down again. I told the suspect to just sit there for a minute and catch his breath then we could go to the patrol cars where it was air-conditioned.

The suspect stated that he was still having trouble breathing and his eyes started to close.
As a certified Texas Department of Health Emergency Care Attendant I took a pulse at his right wrist. The pulse was weak and rapid. Cpl. Clark advised me to get the AED (Automated Electronic Defibrilator) out of my patrol car. I pulled the AED out and placed the AED pads on the suspects chest.
We laid the suspect flat on the ground after un-handcuffing him. The AED advised that no shock was available and to begin CPR. I noticed that the suspects fingers, nose and lips were very cianotic.
I felt for a pulse again and this time did not feel one. I attempted to also get a carotid pulse with no success.

Officer Hicks called Parker County Dispatch and told them to dispatch the Hudson Oaks Fire Department.

Officer Hicks began to unfold the BVM (Bag-Valve-Mask) as I began chest compressions. I heard Cpl. Clark tell the Parker County Dispatch to notify our Chief (K. West) and Lt. Mayberry.

The Hudson Oaks Fire Department arrived on scene approximately 1 minute later.

The Firefighters continued CPR until Lifecare Medic #4 arrived.

The Firefighters and I assisted the Lifecare Paramedics in putting the suspect on a backboard. After we had the suspect placed on the backboard we moved him to the cot. The cot was then lifted into the ambulance. I jumped into the ambulance to stay with the suspect. Firefighter Loller ECA began ventilations and Firefighter Huston EMT-B started chest compressions while the two Lifecare
Paramedics (Briggs EMT-P and Hankins EMT-P) readied the equipment.

Hankins started to drive the ambulance to hospital. (Campbells). CPR was done on the suspect for the entire ride to the hospital. Huston and myself did chest compressions. Loller did ventilations.
Upon arriving at the hospital Dr. Kahn took over the suspect. The hospital staff worked the suspect until the doctor called the suspect deceased at approximately 1844 hrs.

I called my immediate supervisor Cpl. Green and notified him of the details of the incident.

On the suspect a wallet was found that had a drivers license in it that identified him as Weckar, Billy Edward DOB 08/17/53. I kept the wallet and a notepad that was found in Mr. Weckars pocket for safekeeping. I also kept the wallet with the intent to later find phone numbers in the wallet to notify a family member. 

The wallet had 3 dollars (US currency), a Chase Debit Card, a Shell gift card, 1 Wal-Mart gift card, and assorted pictures and business cards.

I received written statements from several Wal-Mart employees that witnessed the theft. A Wal-Mart employee brought the items that were recovered to the Hudson Oaks Police Department to be photographed and put in this report. I photographed all of the items digitally.

The witnesses stated that they did see Mr. Weckar wearing a white straw cowboy hat and talking on a cell phone. Officer Hicks went to the original scene and found a cell phone. The cell phone was identified as being Mr. Weckar's.

Officer Hicks advised me that he did see a pair of sunglasses, a cell phone cover and a white straw cowboy hat in the area that the original detention was made.

I went back to the scene and found the cell phone case, sunglasses, a white straw cowboy hat and a glass pipe commonly used to smoke crack with residue in it. The white straw cowboy hat and glass crack pipe was found in the ravine where I earlier chased the subject.

These items were kept as evidence in locker #78 at the Hudson Oaks Police Department Evidence Room.

Trillo and Alfaro are cousins. The suspect in that case is Jesse Medina. Alfaro was dating and living with Tia Schaeffer. Schaeffer has a baby by Medina. It is thought that this situation is the catalysts for the murder of Trillo.

On 5/22/06 at about 01:00, I was called to the 11th Street Campus about a death. On my arrival, I spoke with Sgt. Ginger Gilmore. She was outside a treatment room that the body of Timothy Alfaro was in . She told me that there had been a call to 1611 Speedway about a naked man in the back yard acting in an odd fashion. On arrival, our Officers found Alfaro face down. He was handcuffed and then found to be in medical crisis. He was unhandcuffed and taken to the hospital by ambulance. Alfaro coded in route. Efforts were made to revive both  in the ambulance and in the hospital. He was pronounced at 00:31 on 5/22/06.

Sgt. Gilmore took me around the E.R. to the location that Officer McBride was with Tia Schaeffer. Tia was in tears. She was Alfaros girlfriend. Tia said that Alfaro had been acting strange the past week. He had been seeing people in the trees and under the stairs that were not there. Tia said Alfaro thought people were trying to kill him. 

Due to Alfaros odd behavior, Tia left on Saturday 05/20/06 and stayed with Tina Darnay on
McGregor Street 322-8393. Tia said that she called several people to go check on Alfaro. I asked who she called. Tia replied that she could not remember who all she called. I asked her to name one person she called and asked to check on Alfaro. She could not name even one person. I detected a note of deception from Tia as she said she had called people to check on Alfaro. She looked down and away as she made that statement and had an odd body movement as she spoke. That is the reason I followed this remark from her with the question about who she called. I was not surprised when she could not name any one.

Tia then said that what had actually happened was that Alfaro had called her on the morning of 05/21/06 and that she did not answers as Alfaro was not acting right. She said that she drove by the apartment and could see that the blinds were messed up and by that she knew he was at home. She said she started calling Alfaro late in the morning of 05/21/06 and that the phone was turned off and he would not answer. By this, Tia said she knew that Alfaro had finally gone to sleep.

Tia said that on 5/21/06, she went by the apartment at about 22:30 hrs. She got some of her belongings and went to stay with her mother at 2510 Marie Street. Alfaro asked if he could come there to visit her and she said yes. Alfaro told her he would follow her. He did not. She called him and he said he would come over as soon as the man under the stairs quit chasing him.

Tia said that she heard Alfaro pull up around 23:30. He did not come to the door and she could hear him yelling. She went out to see what was going on, and saw Alfaro running around yelling things she could not understand. At one point, Alfaro saw a red light on a car alarm. Alfaro said it was a laser weapon that was trying to shoot him. He took off running. By this time, Alfaro had taken off all of his clothing except his underwear shorts. Alfaro ran to Speedway Street and went over a chain link fence into the back yard of 1611 Speedway. Tia called Alfaros mother, Juanita, to come to the scene.

The resident of 1611 Speedway is an 82 year old retired City Marshal. He heard Alfaro in his back yard and called 911. He also went into his back yard. The gates were locked as he had left them. The resident was armed. By the time he got to Alfaro, Alfaro was calmed down. Alfaro laid or fell down.
Officer McBride arrived and went to the back yard of 1611 Speedway. McBride cuffed Alfaro for Officer safety. An ambulance was called to the scene. Once the ambulance arrived, Alfaro was unhandcuffed. The ambulance crew loaded Alfaro into the ambulance and took him to the hospital.

On 5/22/06, Tina Nephew called. She is the mother to Alfaros baby. She said that a neighbor of Alfaros told her that Tia had said she was putting Zoloft in Alfaros beer. I asked Tina to tell me who the neighbor was. She went and got the neighbor. The neighbor said she was Julie Fairchild of 500 Filmore 2E. 

Julie said that about 5 days ago, Tia was at her Julies apartment. Julies brother, Anthony Fairchild and their mother, Amy Wade were there as well. Julie said that Tia was talking about how depressed Alfaro was since the murder of his cousin, and that to help him, she was putting 5 Zoloft a day in his beer, and had been doing this for 3 weeks. Julie also said that she could be reached at her brothers cell phone of 237-5007.

I then called Amy Wade at 704-8340. Wade told me the same story about the five Zoloft a day in Alfaros beer for the past 3 weeks.

Not long after this call, Tia Schaeffer called. She said she was receiving death threats on her voice mail as well as text messages like that. The family of Alfaro was blaming her for the murder of Trillo and the death of Alfaro. She was afraid they were going to kill her. She said she was going to stay with Mike Muniz on Bandera Street.

On 5/23/06, Officer Danny Wiggins and I interviewed Amy Wade at Barwise Junior High School. She is the nurse there. Wade told me that she has moved to 549 West Dickey Road Apartment F. Grand Prairie, Texas 75051. On what she thought was Thursday, 5/18/06, she was at her daughter Julies apartment. That is 500 Filmore 2E. It is across from Timothy Alfaros apartment. On that Thursday, Tia came over to visit Julie. Tia was upset at how Timothy was treating her. Tia made the statement to Julie that she had been placing 5 Zoloft a day in Timothys beer without him knowing. 

At this, Amy Wade told Tia not to do this and why. On the same date, we two Officers also interviewed Julie Fairchild. She had the same information as her mother. On 5/23/06, the preliminary autopsy came in. It noted that there were three fragments of plastic bag (one knotted) recovered from stomach and proximal small bowel. On the same date, I called and spoke with Dr.Page Krouse. He did the autopsy. He said that there was no trace of anything that had been in the bag. If there had
been anything in the bag, it had been absorbed into the body. He said that he put the toxicology on priority one as he knew this would be a pivotal piece of evidence in this case.",,,,,,

Officers observed that Segura appeared to be trying to conceal something in his mouth. While officers were asking Segura to open his mouth to show what was inside, he refused and was making chewing and swallowing motions.

Officers attempted to keep Segura from swallowing whatever substance he had in his mouth, but were unsuccessful. Officers repeatedly urged Segura to not swallow whatever it was he had in his mouth, that if it were narcotics, that it could possibly kill him. Segura still refused to comply.

Officers summoned Beaumont EMS, and Segura was uncooperative with them as well. Segura was then transported to Baptist Hospital with an officer having to ride in the ambulance with them. Once at the hospital, Segura continued to struggle with medical personnel who were trying to treat him, and at one point pulled out an IV on his own.

Glenn and John A. Stroble were assigned to the Southwest Division Burglary Apprehension Team, riding in a two man unit, 91E24. They were working with Officer J. Satterwhite at the Garden Inn Motel, a known high crime location, conducting proactive investigations.

Officer Satterwhite was working in an undercover capacity and notified Glenn and Stroble that a white
Chevrolet Impala that had appeared suspicious had just left the location and warranted further investigation. He relayed to the unit the vehicle description and that as the vehicle left the location the driver had committed the traffic violation of failing to use the first available lane when making a right hand turn as it pulled out of the motel parking lot.

Officers Glenn and Stroble located the vehicle traveling east bound on Reed Rd. They observed the vehicle make an abrupt U-turn without signaling and continue west bound on Reed Rd. They caught up to the vehicle, activating their emergency equipment to initiate a traffic stop. The vehicle slowed down, but continued to roll slowly for a longer time than necessary, passing several areas where it could have stopped. 

Both officers observed the driver of the vehicle reaching into his center console and then place his hand near his mouth, appearing to be placing items in his mouth. They observed him make this movement several times before he finally came to a complete stop.

The vehicle stopped in the 2100 block of Reed Rd. The officers exited their vehicle to make contact with the driver. Officer Glenn had been driving the patrol vehicle and approached the vehicle from the driver's side, as Officer Stroble approached from the passenger side. As they approached the vehicle, Officer Glenn observed the driver of the vehicle, later identified as Michael A. Charles, throw a small white object into this mouth and swallow hard. Charles then opened up his driver's door and exited the vehicle as directed to by Officer Glenn.

The officers asked Charles what he had eaten, and he denied having placed anything in his mouth. He was asked to open his mouth, which he did, and the officers did not observe any white residue or narcotics in his mouth. The officers continued with their investigation, placing Charles into handcuffs and into the back seat of their patrol vehicle. In the course of their investigation, they were joined by another two man unit with the Southwest BAT, Officers Stewart and Contreras riding unit 91E25. 
While Officer Stroble spoke with the Harris County District Attorney's Office, Office Glenn searched Charles' white Chevrolet Impala. In that search, Glenn found a small baggie under the driver's seat that contained white residue which tested positive for cocaine content. During the course of the investigation, the officers continued to ask Charles if he had swallowed any narcotic, telling him that if he did, he would need medical attention.

Charles continued to deny that he had swallowed anything. After locating the baggie in his vehicle, Charles finally admitted to swallowing a single dime bag of cocaine.  Officers immediately requested HFD to the location for their prisoner who had possibly ingested cocaine. Charles overheard the request and became irritable, telling the officers that he did not need an ambulance, claiming to have a high tolerance. HFD arrived within minutes and spoke with Charles. 

In the course of their conversation, Charles admitted to the Paramedics that in addition, he had taken two ecstasy pills. As HFD checked his vitals, Charles asked to be let out of the patrol vehicle so he could stand up. The officers allowed it, and as he was outside of their vehicle they noticed that Charles was having difficulty standing. They observed that his knees were starting to buckle, and that his speech was starting to slur. They sat him back down in the back of the patrol vehicle and he started to have a seizure. The paramedics advised that they would transport Charles. It was determined that he would be transported to St. Joseph Medical Center, located at 1401 St. Joseph Pkwy in downtown Houston.

The paramedics loaded Charles into the ambulance with Officer Glenn riding in the back with him. Officer Stroble followed in their patrol vehicle. During transport, Officer Glenn observed Charles have several more seizures, at the end of one Charles vomited. In the vomitus, Officer Glenn observed two small baggies that appeared to have been chewed up. 

Upon arrival at St. Joseph Medical Center, as Charles was brought into the Emergency Center, he stopped breathing and lost his pulse. The St. Joseph staff immediately began life saving measures, including performing CPR, administering medications, and using a defibrillator in an attempt to revive Charles. Their attempts were not successful, and Michael Charles was pronounced dead by St. Joseph staff at 10:25 a.m. 

The autopsy on Michael Charles was performed the following day by Dr. Sara Doyle with the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. During the autopsy, at least two additional baggies were identified in Michael Charles' body. One was discovered in his stomach and another in his upper digestive tract. 

Both bags were ruptured with no identifiable contents remaining. Dr. Doyle was unable to immediately rule on the manner and cause of Michael Charles' death, which will be pending further examination by the HCIFS.",,d,11,,,

Upon arrival, the officers observed a nude white male adult, later identified as Johnny Reeves, lying in bushes and mumbling incomprehensibly. Mr. Reeves was seen to be behaving in a manner consistent with a person who was intoxicated. Officers detained Mr. Reeves and, for his safety and the safety of the officers, placed him into handcuffs. 

Mr. Reeves did not resist and no use of force was necessary to place him in the handcuffs. Officers
then contacted dispatch and requested emergency medical services to come to the scene and evaluate Mr. Reeves. While waiting for HFD to arrive, Mr. Reeves was lying on his side and continued mumbling incoherently. Shortly after HFD EMS arrived on scene, Mr. Reeves was placed on the HFD stretcher. Officer Bazan removed the handcuffs from Mr. Reeves, who had only been detained and was not under arrest. 

After the handcuffs were removed, and while inside the ambulance, HFD personnel noted the man's condition appeared to deteriorate. Prior to the ambulance leaving the scene, ambulance personnel indicated to the Officer Bazan on scene that the patient appeared to be entering cardiac arrest. HFD personnel administered CPR on scene and Mr. Reeves' condition improved and his heartbeat returned. HFD personnel then transported Mr. Reeves to Kingwood Hospital. 

After arriving at Kingwood Hospital, the patient was moved from the ambulance to an emergency room within the hospital under Medical Record Number CD 00505233. Mr. Reeves again suffered cardiac arrest and CPR was administered. Mr. Reeves then died at the hospital under
the care of Dr. Chou, and was pronounced dead by ER personnel at 10:21 PM. He did not appear to have any obvious injury or suffer any external trauma which caused his death. 

Mr. Reeves tested positive for amphetamines at the hospital and his body temperature was 104 when he arrived at the hospital. Montgomery County took custody of the deceased under Medical Legal number 15-0530, and will perform a post-mortem examination. Mr. Reeves has a criminal history spanning from 1991 to 2012 which includes multiple assaults, family violence, theft, possession of a controlled substance, unlawful possession of a firearm by felon and failure to stop and give information.

K. Anderson and A. J. Ruben. The Officers only police action was to place handcuffs on the male at the request of HFD Personnel based on Nessing's erratic behavior at the original scene located at 13200 Rockglen in Houston, Harris County, Texas. 

Nessing was only detained to facilitate medical treatment, and there was no intention to arrest or charge him for a criminal offense. The original reportee left the scene before officers were able to obtain a statement, and investigators attempts to contact the reportee have been
unsuccessful.  

Officer Anderson responded to a suicide / just occurred at 13200 Rockglen at approximately 8:47 PM. He arrived to find HFD personnel standing near a white male, later identified as Nessing, along the sidewalk. The male was incoherent and irrational as he knelt on the ground. Officer Anderson observed the male grunting as he dug his hands into the ground and punched the sidewalk with his bare hands. The HFD Personnel commented that the male appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance, and they requested that Officer Anderson detain the male with handcuffs, based on his erratic behavior, in order to safely treat him. HFD Personnel informed Officer Anderson that the male had been running around in circles and deliberately running into the side of a firetruck parked along the street. 

Officer Anderson attempted to communicate with the male; however, his attempts were unsuccessful as the male responded with incoherent slurs or gibberish. Officer Anderson called for back-up to assist in detaining the male. Officer Ruben arrived, and the male rolled across the ground before an HFD employee stopped him. Officer Ruben and Officer Anderson continued attempts to communicate with the male, and the male complied with their requests to place his hands behind his back. Officer Ruben placed handcuffs on the male at approximately 9:00 PM, and HFD Paramedics began attempts to treat the male as his physical condition appeared to deteriorate. 

Once an HFD ambulance arrived, Officer Ruben removed the handcuffs, and the male was loaded into an ambulance where paramedics began treating him at the scene. The male was transported to East Houston Regional Medical Center where he was eventually pronounced dead at 10:09 PM
by Dr. Nkeiruka Onyenekwu.  The male was identified on Friday October 23, 2015, as Casey Edward Nessing, by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences through fingerprints associated with his Texas State Identification Number. Nessing also has an alias name of Casey Edward Turner under which his Texas Identification is issued. An autopsy was conducted revealing no immediate cause and manner of death. The results are pending a full panel of toxicology testing and will not be available for several weeks.

The violations were no seatbelt by driver and failure to signal a right turn. 

Both officers smelled marijuana when they approached the vehicle. Officer Martinez saw the front passenger drinking a ""Big Gulp"" and it appeared that he had swallowed something. The driver confirmed that the passenger had swallowed some type of drug. Officer Martinez handled the passenger (Carlos Mata) and Officer Dominguez handled the driver (Michael Palafos).

Both males were asked to get out of the vehicle and handcuffed.

The original caller advised that Juan Lopez had threatened to burn his (and spouses) house along with all their possessions. The caller stated that Lopez was actively pouring a flammable substance (gasoline) on and around the residence. Officers arrived on scene and noticed a smell of the flammable substance (gasoline), but Lopez was not present. 

While investigating the incident, Lopez arrived in his vehicle and began to douse himself with a flammable substance (gasoline) while still inside his vehicle. Lopez exited his vehicle and began to splash gasoline at responding officers and threatened to ignite the officers. Lopez approached the residence in an apparent attempt to either enter the residence or ignite the residence. Officers were originally advised that another subject may be inside the residence and took actions to prevent Lopez entry. 

Officers deployed O.C. pepper spray (oleoresin capsicum) to Lopez face but the O.C.
spray had no effect. Lopez then splashed the flammable substance (gasoline) contained in a red plastic container on the officer deploying the O.C. Spray. Lopez, holding a butane cigarette lighter, approached the officer and made overt threats to ignite both himself and the officer. 

The officer retreated in an effort to prevent Lopez imminent commission of serious bodily injury or death to the officer and/or Lopez. Other responding officers recognized the threat and attempted to subdue Lopez by deploying a neuromuscular incapacitation device (Taser). The first deployment had little of no effect due to ineffective placement of the probe contacts. Another officer deployed a Taser which appeared to be effective. Approximately 1 to 2 seconds later, Lopez burst into flames. 

The source of ignition has not been determined inconclusively. Officers immediately began to extinguish Lopez and called to expedite responding fire and ambulance personnel. Officers were able to extinguish Lopez with fire extinguishers prior to fire department personnel. Fire department personnel flushed Lopez with water to further extinguish Lopez and minimize further injury due to heat and/or flames.

The pursuit lasted about 3 minutes and Mr. Tamez wrecked his vehicle into a stop sign and eventually came into a stop. Mr. Tamez fled on foot and was caught trying to scale a chain link fence. Mr. Tamez resisted arrest against two Officers. While the struggle to arrest occurred Sgt. R. Cavazos deployed a Taser on Mr. Tamez to gain compliance. Mr. Tamez was wearing a heavy leather jacket and one probe was caught in the jacket and the second probe became lodged in a toothbrush that Mr. Tamez was carrying in his jacket pocket. This resulted in a failure of the Taser to make a proper connection and an effective deployment of the Taser. 

The officers had to use physical force to handcuff Mr. Tamez and make the arrest. Mr. Tamez then resisted the entry into the police unit and Sgt. Cavazos then deployed his taser in drive stun mode. Sgt. Cavazos drive stunned Mr.Tamez once on ankle and once on the right arm in order to gain compliance on entering the rear seat of the police unit.

Mr. Tamez was given a plastic urinal in order to gather a sample but Mr. Tamez made motions like he was having sex with it and did not provide a sample. 

Mr. Tamez was taken to get x-rays but only one was obtained because he kept masturbating and would not stop. Eventually a catheter was used to get a urine sample and the medical personnel advised Officer Gonzalez that Mr. Tamez showed positive for cocaine and marijuana. Mr. Tamez continued breathing heavily and masturbating. 

Mr. Tamez then collapsed onto the bed and turned pale. Officer Gonzalez notified the nurse.

Next I noticed an abrasion on the right side of Juan Perez' face on the upper area of his cheek between his right ear and eye. Next I noticed an abrasion on his right shoulder. I noticed cuts on both his right and left wrist area and on both the right and left ankles. I also noticed a small scrape on his left shoulder. 

After taking photographs I spoke with Sgt. Easley who explained that he along with Taft Police Officer Rusty Graham were dispatched to 402 Harding St. for a disturbance between a male and female. Sgt. Easley stated that he and Officer Graham located the male later identified as Juan Perez at 603 Victoria. Sgt. Easley stated that after attacking his wife Sylvia Perez who ran away at 402 Harding Juan Perez went to 603 Victoria and attacked a lady who was sitting on her front porch. 

Sgt. Easley stated that Officer Graham was first on scene. Sgt. Easley stated that when he arrived Officer Graham had taken Juan Perez to the ground and was trying to restrain Juan Perez but Juan Perez was fighting with Officer Graham. Sgt. Easley stated that he was going to Taze Juan Perez but could smell alcohol coming from Juan Perez and felt the tazer would not be effective. Sgt. Easley stated that he and Officer Graham continued to fight with Juan Perez but they were able to handcuff Juan Perez. 

Sgt. Easley stated that even after Juan Perez was handcuffed he continued to fight. Sgt. Easley stated that Juan Perez continued to yell, kick and roll around. Sgt. Easley stated that after Juan Perez was handcuffed and had calmed down he sat him up and noticed Juan Perez was bleeding. Sgt. Easley stated they called for EMS to come check Juan Perez before transporting him to the jail. Sgt. Easley stated that Juan Perez tried several times to stand up. 

Sgt. Easley stated that at one point he was trying to talk to Juan Perez and Juan Perez stated I see what you have in your hand and when Sgt. Easley asked what he was talking about Juan Perez told him that he was holding a snake. Sgt. Easley also stated that when EMS arrived he would not let them close to him because he said they had a bag full of snakes. 

Sgt. Easley stated that he placed leg irons on Juan Perez because he had kicked several of the officers and had also attempted to kick EMS personnel. Sgt. Easley stated that after Deputy Bernal and Cpl. Solis arrived they placed Juan Perez in the back of Officer Graham's patrol car. Sgt. Easley stated that a second set of leg irons was used to try and restrict Juan Perez' movement. Sgt. Easley went on to explain that one end of the leg irons was attached to the hand cuffs and the other to the leg irons on Juan Perez' ankles. 

Sgt. Easley stated at this point Officer Graham transported Juan Perez to the jail. Sgt. Easley stated that he learned from Sylvia Perez that Juan Perez had been drinking and using cocaine. Sgt. Easley also stated that Sylvia Perez told him that Juan Perez hallucinates about snakes when he uses
crack cocaine. 

In his statement Correctional Officer Dalton states that when Officer Graham arrived at the jail Juan Perez was lying face down in the back seat of Officer Graham's patrol car handcuffed behind his back with his feet restrained. Correctional Officer Dalton further states that Juan Perez was incoherently screaming. 

Correctional Officer Dalton stated that when Officer Graham opened the rear driver's side door Juan Perez began to kick. Correctional Officer Dalton stated he along with Deputy Jan Raska, Correctional Officer Lopez, and Correctional Officer Roefer pulled Juan Perez from the patrol car and carried Juan Perez into the jail where they placed him face down on the floor of the padded cell. Correctional Officer Dalton stated he removed the handcuff from Juan Perez and Correctional Officer Roefer removed the leg restraints. Correctional Officer Dalton stated that Juan Perez was responding to their commands while they were removing the restraints. Correctional Officer Dalton stated that they removed Juan Perez' clothing because it is procedure to remove the clothing of any person placed into the padded cell. 

Correctional Officer Dalton states they ordered Juan Perez to stay face down on the floor until they exited the cell. Correctional Officer Dalton stated that as soon as the door was closed and locked he looked back in and noticed that Juan Perez had not moved and was still in the same position he was in when they exited the cell. 

Correctional Officer Dalton states that he, Cpl. Solis and Deputy Raska all three noticed Juan Perez was breathing but he was not moving. Correctional Officer Dalton stated that he decided to go back into the cell to check on Juan Perez. Correctional Officer Dalton stated he, Cpl. Solis and Deputy Raska all three went back into the cell and he heard Cpl. Solis tell someone to call EMS. 

Correctional Officer Dalton states that he along with Correctional Officer Lopez and Correctional Officer Roefer rolled Juan Perez onto his back. Correctional Officer Dalton stated that he noticed that Juan Perez was breathing but was still unresponsive with his eyes slightly open. Correctional Officer Dalton stated that they left the cell and locked the door. Correctional Officer Dalton stated a short time later Sinton EMS arrived and he unlocked the door.

The driver was identified as Lesa Ann Surratt, w/f, DOB: 06/01/1962. 

Surratt was subsequently placed under arrest for the traffic violation, handcuffed behind her back and placed into the back left passenger seat of the Sherman Police vehicle. Said police unit was equipped with an in-car video which had the capability to record the interior portion of the unit. 

The video recording showed Surratt removing her left hand from the handcuff, reaching underneath her dress, retrieving an object and placing said object into her mouth. Quickly thereafter, a Sherman Police Officer discovered Surratt had removed the handcuff and observed she had something in her mouth. Two Sherman Police Officers used pressure point techniques on the side of Surratts neck in an attempt to make her open her mouth and to keep her from swallowing the item, which was believed to be illegal narcotics. 

Surratt refused all commands by the officers and was removed from the back of the patrol vehicle. It was at this time the officers observed Surratt turning blue around her face and realized she was not breathing. A Sherman Police Officer immediately called for an ambulance to his location. While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, numerous Sherman Police Officers provided first aid, in the form of chest compressions and the Heimlich maneuver, to Surratt.

 Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics with the Sherman Fire Department used forceps to remove a plastic sandwich bag, containing an off white color substance, from Surratts throat. Surratt was transported to a local hospital where she was placed on life support. Ranger Oliver spoke with the medical staff who indicated Surratt had suffered from oxygen deprivation for over 7 minutes which had resulted in her being brain dead. On 09/02/2013, Surratt died in the hospital.",ed,,11,,,

C. Williams observed a black Chevy Suburban traveling north on Samuel between Duncan and N. MacArthur, Coppell, Dallas County, Texas. I was traveling south on Samuel and I observed the Suburban's high beams illuminated as I approached. I turned around and the Suburban stopped at the red light at Samuel and N. MacArthur. 

I followed the Suburban as it turned north on N. MacArthur. The Suburban was directly behind a tan four-door vehicle as it traveled north in the left lane. I changed lanes into the right lane and drove next to the Suburban. 

As I pulled ahead of the Suburban, I observed the high beams still illuminated as it was following the four door vehicle, about five car lengths behind. I initiated a traffic stop on the Suburban by activating the overhead lights of my fully marked patrol vehicle (Tahoe #913). The Suburban came to a stop on Lake Vista, just east of N. MacArthur Blvd., in Lewisville, Denton County, Texas in the right lane of traffic. I positioned my patrol vehicle directly behind the Suburban.

I made contact with the male driver, who was the only occupant of the Suburban. He stated he did not have a drivers license when asked and stated he did not have his wallet. He verbally identified himself as Steven Irwin with date of birth as 08/30/67. He also stated that his drivers license was suspended. Irwin stated he was coming from some female's apartment and he was following his friend. He also admitted to drinking earlier in the night. 

Officer Odean arrived as I was speaking with Irwin. I noticed that the rear compartment of the Suburban was full with what appeared to be construction items including buckets and extension cords. Irwin stated he worked installing ceramic tile. 

I then returned to my patrol vehicle. A computer check of Irwin revealed a single warrant from Dallas P.D. with a DOW (date of warrant) of 08/19/10. I asked Coppell Dispatch to check the status of Irwin's Texas drivers license. Coppell Dispatch advised that Irwin's license was suspended and the dispatcher indicated that he had the regional warrant hit from Dallas P.D. 

Because Irwin admitted to drinking, I asked Odean to perform the HGN evaluation on Irwin. Officer Odean and I then approached the Suburban. I asked Irwin to step from the vehicle and explained that he could turn it off to save gas. Irwin turned the engine of his Suburban off and exited the vehicle. He was cooperative and I explained that I wanted to have an officer make sure he was alright to drive since he admitted to drinking. 

I also explained that we (City of Coppell) have been having a lot of thefts in the area and I asked him if he would mind me searching his vehicle for stolen items. He then granted me permission to search his Suburban. Officer Odean then met with Irwin as I searched the Suburban. I searched the front driver's area and the rear section of the vehicle. I did not observe any contraband or any items that I suspected to be stolen. I walked back to the sidewalk and made contact with Irwin. I explained that he had a warrant from the Dallas Police Department and told him that he needed to take care of it. 

I then told him he could go on his way and he walked back to his Suburban and got into the driver's seat. Officer Odean and I stood on the sidewalk expecting Irwin to drive off, but he was unable to start his Suburban. Irwin stated that his Suburban was recently stolen and his ignition was broken. He stated that he had to use a screwdriver to start it, but the ignition would not function. 

After several minutes of Irwin attempting to start the vehicle, he finally stated that it would not start. He asked if he would be able to leave it parked. I explained that he could not because he was in a lane of traffic. Irwin then asked if he could call his brother. I asked how long that would take and he said one hour. I told him that was too long to wait and I explained that we would push his vehicle into the parking lot just north of our location. I then called for another patrol officer to arrive, and Officer Roberts later arrived at the scene. 

Officer Odean made contact with Irwin as Officer Roberts and I stood near the rear of the Suburban preparing to push. I hard Officer Odean ask Irwin if he was okay. I was then able to see Irwin exit his vehicle. He was sweating heavily and his balance was not steady. Officer Odean asked Irwin to step to the side of the road and Irwin walked to the sidewalk near the rear of his vehicle and laid down on the grass easement. I noticed that Irwin was chewing on something and Irwin was acting very strange.

I then requested a Coppell Paramedic to respond to the scene. Irwin remained on the grass for a few minutes. He was rolling around and yelling. I asked him several times what he took as it appeared he ingested something. He continued yelling after my repeated requests for him to tell me what he took as I explained that I called for an ambulance and help would be arriving. Irwin refused to spit the item he had in his mouth out.

 Irwin continued to lay on the ground as he was moving around. He appeared to try to get up, so I grabbed onto Irwin and so did Officer Odean and Officer Roberts. Irwin was laying on his stomach and his hands were under his chest with only his elbows exposed. I repeatedly told Irwin that we were only trying to help him. I told him to place his hands behind his back several times and to also spit out the item in his mouth. 

Irwin did not comply and continued to struggle. I then requested another unit to come to the location and Officer Mathews began to respond. While we were on the ground with Irwin, a white male walked into the median of the roadway. He stated he was called by a friend and told that one of his friends was being arrested. I told the male that if he did not know this guy (Irwin) then he needed to leave.

 I was unable to get a good look at the male, because he walked away shortly after I told him he needed to leave. As we continued to struggle with Irwin, he did not comply with commands to removed his hands from underneath him. Officer Odean was able to remove one of Irwin's hands and place it behind Irwins back. Irwin continued to struggle and yell. 

I attempted to use a departmental issued flashlight to remove his other arm from underneath his chest. I inserted the end of the flashlight into the inner bend of this elbow in an attempt to pry his arm from underneath him. It was not effective and I removed the flashlight from the inner bend of his elbow. 

Irwin then became quiet and I was able to remove his hand from underneath him. Officer Odean then
placed him into handcuffs with my assistance. I was able to see that the item Irwin was checking on was a plastic baggie. It appeared to have been tied in a fashion to store narcotics. I then advised Coppell Dispatch to notify the responding paramedics of the narcotics use. 

Irwin was no longer yelling and he was not making any sounds. Irwin was then placed into a seating position on the grass and was held there by Odean and Roberts. I could see him breathing, but he was not responsive.

I heard one officer say that they could feel a pulse. After only about one to two minutes of Irwin being
handcuffed, the Coppell Fire Department arrived. I met with a responding paramedic and explained the situation. 

The paramedics met with Irwin and one stated that they did not think he had a pulse. One paramedic asked us to remove the handcuffs and I assisted Officer Odean in removing the handcuffs. Members of the Fire Department then began to treat Irwin. I observed as Irwin was placed into the rear of an ambulance and I observed as Paramedics attempted CPR. Inside the ambulance, one Paramedic removed several plastic baggies from Irwins mouth. 

The baggies were chewed up and I retrieved them from the floor of the ambulance. I placed them into a new rubber glove and I gave the glove to Officer Roberts and made sure the other plastic baggie that fell from Irwin's mouth on the grass was also retrieved. After several minutes of treatment, the ambulance and Paramedics prepared to leave. I was told that Irwin did not have a pulse or heartbeat. They then transported Irwin to Lewisville Medical Center and Officer Odean followed. At about 0605 hours, Officer Odean telephoned me and advised that Irwin was deceased.",ed,,,,,

Officer Edge was dispatched at 02:28 am and arrived at the scene at 02:28 am. Officer Edge followed a fluid trail to a parking lot located at 4141 College Hills Boulevard, San Angelo, Texas. 

Officer Edge arrived at the parking lot at 02:33 am. Officer Edge observed a black Pontiac Grand Am that had been wrecked. Officer Edge also observed a gold 2-door passenger car at the scene.

Officer Edge made contact with the driver of the gold car, Alexander Peschard, W/M, 07-18-1981. Peschard advised he and two other Hispanic males were there to help the driver of the black Pontiac, Jose Garcia, H/M, 06-18-1983. 

The owner of the black Pontiac, Garcia was driving was Lee Ray Medina, H/M, 07-18-1981. Medina was present in the gold car with Peschard. Officer Edge stated Peschard had attempted to drive off prior to contact with Officer Edge, so Officer Edge informed Peschard he and the other males in the care were not free to leave until the investigation into the accident was complete. 

Other officers with the San Angelo Police Department arrived to provide assistance with scene security. While Officer Edge was talking to the driver of the black Pontiac, Garcia, Peschard began to become in distress. Peschard was sweating profusely, scratching at his stomach and requested an ambulance. 

Peschard stated to officers he was taking some type of medication for some type of infection and having an allergic reaction to the medication. An ambulance with the San Angelo Fire Department was dispatched to the scene.

The ambulance arrived at the scene and paramedics began assessing Peschard. EMS personnel attempted to get Peschard to walk to the ambulance, but Peschard was rigid, leaning on the gold car, with bulging wide opened eyes and could not move. A stretcher was brought to Peschard's location at which point Peschard collapsed on the ground. Peschard was loaded onto the stretcher and into the ambulance. 

EMS personnel requested Officer Edge travel with the ambulance to assist with security and control of Peschard. Both EMS personnel and Officer Edge recognized the actions as being consistent with taking a large dosage of a dangerous drug, possibly methamphetamine. EMS personnel began to administer a counteracting agent to Peschard. 

While traveling to the hospital Peschard began to flail wildly and pulled the IV out of his arm. Officer Edge provided assistance with securing a towel around Peschard's arm to control bleeding. Officer Edge stated when at West Texas Community hospital in San Angelo, Texas hospital staff attempted to administer medicine to aid Peschard. Officer Edge was requested by hospital staff to secure Peschard's arms with handcuffs to the bed rails for safety. Officer Edge did so with issued handcuffs. Peschard became rigid and went into cardiac arrest. 

Hospital staff worked on Peschard until 4:29 am when he as pronounced deceased. Investigators with the San Angelo Police Department were called as was a supervisor and crime scene technicians. Officer Edge had not charged Peschard with any offense or placed Peschard under arrest for any offense at the time of the incident. Peschard was detained until Officer Edge was completed with the accident investigation. It was later learned Peschard had swallowed a corner bag of suspected methamphetamine sometime prior to or around the time of initial contact with Officer Edge. The bag was recovered on 3/23/10 at the Tarrant County Medical Examiners Office.",ed,,11,,,

approximately 7:30 am for theft. On Tuesday, February 24, 2009, at approximately 7:15 am the decedent went inside a Walgreens store at 3317 Montrose Blvd. While inside the store he asked the clerk, Ugo Okafor, for cigarettes. The decedent received a couple of cartons and then ran out of the store without paying. 

The clerk, Okafor, and the manager, Mr. Mata, both gave chase to the decedent. The store clerk tackled the decedent in the parking lot. 

The clerk and the manager were able to get their cigarettes back so they let the decedent go and returned to the store to make the report to the police. Officers broadcasted a description of the decedent and an officer searched the area. Officer Weller (71657) found the decedent at the 900 block of Westheimer, in the Taco Cabana restaurant. Houston Fire Department ambulance #16 was treating the decedent. 

According to Officer Weller the only visible injury on the decedent was a cut lip. Officer Weller asked the decedent what happened and he said that he was assaulted. Officer Weller asked him who assaulted him and he said that when he stole the cigarettes the two clerks tackled him, hit him, took their cigarettes back and left him. 

The decedent complained to Officer Weller that his ribs hurt and he was having a hard time breathing.
Houston Fire Department ambulance #16 told Officer Weller that the decedent was fine and that they were not going to transport him. Officer Weller had clerk Okafor come to the scene. Okafor made a positive identification of the decedent as the person who stole the cigarettes. Officer Ash (83714) called the Harris County District Attorneys office and Felony Theft charges were accepted due to the decedent's criminal history of theft. 

Officer Weller then transported the decedent to the central jail at around 8:00 am. The decedent was screened by jail personnel and the initial medical screening was done. At approximately 10:00 am the city of Houston health care worker, Dr. Lourdes (99609) called for a police unit to come to the jail and take the decedent to Ben Taub hospital. Officer Ash responded to the jail and transported the decedent to Ben Taub. 

The only thing given to Officer Ash was a slip of paper titled City Of Houston Prisoner Hospital Report. This report under illness or injury states left shoulder trauma dislocation or fracture with a question mark after the notation. Upon arrival, on Tuesday, February 24, 2009, at Ben Taub hospital, the decedent was admitted and assigned a bed for treatment. 

The initial report indicated that the decedent was suffering from extensive emphysema, rib fracture, pneumonia, a fractured collar bone, cirrhosis and aspiration. Since felony theft charges were accepted on the decedent and he was now an admitted patient the hospital box was checked on the D.I.M.S. charges. Despite charges having been filed on February 24, 2009, the Harris County Sheriffs Department had not yet assigned a deputy from the hospital ward to watch the prisoner. The Houston Police Central Patrol Division officers stayed with the decedent from February 24, 2009 to February 28, 2009, until the decedent was released by Ben Taub Hospital and booked at the county jail. 

On February 28, 2009, doctors at Ben Taub released the decedent and said to transport him directly to the county jail. The decedent was a very large man over 300 pounds. Officer Cardenas was assigned to take the decedent to the jail. Officer Cardenas saw that the decedent was able to dress himself and walk without any problems.

He also saw that the clothing the hospital had given the decedent to wear was exposing his penis. Officer Cardenas was then given pants so he could put the pants on to cover his genitals. 

Officer Cardenas saw that the decedent was having difficulty putting his pants on and helped him. The decedent complained that he was having trouble breathing so Ben Taub Hospital staff gave him oxygen. Once he was dressed and rested, Ben Taub staff cleared him to be transported to the jail. Officer Cardenas is small in stature and was a one man unit. Officer Cardenas used 2 sets of handcuffs to secure the decedent's hands behind his back. 

Officer Cardenas only saw that there was a neck brace on the decedent and was not told about any shoulder injuries or given any specific instructions on the care of the decedent. Officer Cardenas transported the decedent to the Harris County Jail. As Officer Cardenas was waiting in the sally port, the decedent complained of being uncomfortable. 

Officer Cardenas told him he would have medical help. Officer Cardenas then got the decedent out of the back of his patrol car and while in the sally port Harris County Sheriff deputies and sergeants came to the aid of Officer Cardenas because they saw that the decedent was unsteady on his feet and then collapsed. C.P.R. and an AED was used on the decedent. HFD ambulance #3 arrived and transported the decedent to the nearest hospital which was St. Joseph's. 

Dr. Margulis pronounced the decedent dead after about an hour of working on him with a ""flat-line."" He was pronounced dead at 2:20 pm on February 28, 2009.",ed,,,,,

Officer Benson #178 tells Morton to stay in the car. Officer Benson #178 walks back to his vehicle and sends Officer Morales #729 a message to come assist him. Officer Morales #729 arrives at 0012 hrs. At that time Officer Benson # 178 asked Morton who was driving to step out of the vehicle. Officer Morales # 729 asks the W1 passenger to step out also.

 There are no other individuals in the car. Officer Benson #178 obtains verbal consent from Morton to search his person. At this time, Officer Benson #178 observes Morton start pulling what Officer Benson #178 believes were narcotics from his pockets, and then shoving them into his mouth quickly. 

Officer Benson #178 from his training and experience knew Morton was destroying evidence in his presence. A struggle ensues between Officer Benson who is 5' 5"" and 150 lbs against Morton who is 6' 0"" and at least 240. Officer Benson #178 can't get Morton under control.

 The struggle continues for 1 more minute before they manage to get Morton handcuffed and under control at 0021. They call for EMS after Morton becomes unresponsive. 

It appears the Officers were struggling with Morton for at least 9 minutes before getting him under control, based on the times noted by the dispatcher's key card. It is unknown how many balloons of heroin and packets of cocaine he ingested during the struggle. After the AP was handcuffed, Officer Benson #178 recovered 2 balloons of heroin, and 3 small packets of cocaine that fell from APs mouth during the struggle. 

These items were tested and were positive for cocaine and heroin. 

When EMS arrived they had trouble getting the intubation tube down Morton's throat. The EMTs stated they could see blue pills at the back of Morton's mouth. During Autopsy one chewed up package of cocaine was recovered from Morton's mouth.",ed,,11,,,

#91H17 viewed a pedestrian violation in the 2600 block of Riverside at 1823 hours on Monday, October 8, 2007. Located in the 2600 block of Riverside is the Ladet Motel, which is known to officers as having a high level of narcotics activity and prostitution. 

As the officers drove up to the motel driveway they observed the suspect walk out of the motel driveway and walk west in the street in the 2600 block of Riverside. At that time, the officers observed the suspect holding something in his right hand. Officers Laird and Coronado stopped to arrest the suspect for the pedestrian violation and advised the suspect to stop. Officer Coronado exited the passenger side of the car and then approached the suspect. 

Officer Coronado then observed the suspect place his right hand to his mouth and observed what he believed to be several rocks of crack cocaine in his hand. The suspect then began to chew on the substance. 

Officer Coronado again told the suspect to stop but he began to walk away at a faster pace from Officer Coronado. The suspect then began running from Officer Coronado on foot. Officer Coronado then began chasing the suspect on foot. 

Officer Coronado was able to overtake the suspect a short distance from the motel and then wrestle him down to the ground. Officer Laird ran up to where Officer Coronado was struggling with the suspect in an attempt to handcuff him. The suspect refused to submit to the officers who were attempting to place handcuffs on him. 

The suspect continued to resist officers attempts to place handcuffs on him as Officers Martinez and Medel ran up to assist. All four officers were then able to restrain the suspect and place handcuffs on him. The officers then stood the suspect up and began walking with him to the side of the street. As the officers were walking with him, the suspect again began to resist and struggle with officers. The officers then placed the suspect against the hood of the patrol vehicle where they were able to control him. While they had the suspect against the patrol vehicle, the officers observed a small amount of blood and white residue on the outer part of the suspects mouth. The white residue was field tested by Officer Coronado, which resulted in a positive reaction for cocaine.

After Sergeant H. Giraldo arrived on the arrest scene, the suspect began to resist again and struggle with officers. The officers again had to wrestle the suspect to the ground to restrain him and then they interlocked his legs with restraints. The suspect was then placed on his right side.

 At that time, the suspect appeared to have a seizure and a HFD ambulance was called to the scene. HFD ambulance #16 arrived on the scene and the restraints were removed from his legs so the suspect could be treated and placed on the gurney. The suspect continued to resist and struggle with officers and bit the glove off of paramedic Williford's hand. 

Officer Coronado then rode in the ambulance with the suspect and paramedic to Ben Taub Hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, the suspect's blood pressure dropped, which resulted in cardiac arrest. Doctors in the emergency room were able to revive the suspect where he was stabilized. The suspect was later transferred to floor 6F bed 4. While the suspect was being treated, a urine test was conducted on him and was found to have unknown amounts of cocaine, marijuana and PCP in it. 

Dr. Serge Golovine pronounced the suspect dead at 0444 hours at Ben Taub Hospital. Prior to the suspects death, criminal charges of Tampering with Evidence were accepted by Assistant District Attorney A. Baimbridge and filed under HPD case number 148080807-L.",ed,,11,,,

First St. 

The manager of the hotel reported that a w/m was sitting on the tailgate of a pickup and talking to his self. When officers arrived they located Brandon Kort, w/m, 6-08-78 inside room 101. Kort stated that he had driven from Shreveport and stopped at the hotel because he was tired.

He consented to the search of his room and officers found no illegal substances. He was issued a ticket for parking in a handicap parking space and officers left the area. At approximately 1:57 pm officers received a second call concerning this same individual. Management of the hotel reported that Kort was acting irrational and might have taken some type of narcotic or drug. 

When officers arrived they were met by the manager and Kort's wife, Jeanna Henderson. She stated that Kort had taken something and also felt that he was suicidal. She too, informed them that Kort had quit his job this date and they had been arguing earlier in the day. 

As officers made contact with Kort, they saw that he was sweating profusely. For officer safety, he was handcuffed without incident and placed in the back seat of a patrol car. Within a few minutes he became very agitated and unruly. Officers felt that a medical evaluation was immediately necessary and transported him directly to Memorial Hospital. 

While driving to the hospital, Officer Seymore noticed that Kort's condition had progressed, and he was not able to understand what Kort was saying. At the hospital, Kort became very combative and had to be restrained by officers and medical staff. He was restrained to the bed with police handcuffs and hospital leg restraints. 

At one point a spit hood was placed on Kort, to prevent him from spitting on the nurses that were attending to him. This hood, along with the restraints in place, was later removed as the staff continued to work on him. His heart rate got very high and his temperature rose to 107 degrees. On one occasion he began to choke and a suction tube was used to clear his airway. As this was being completed, small plastic pieces of material were removed from his throat. 

(A physician ordered drug screen was conducted, and revealed a presumptive positive for methamphetamines.) Medical staff worked on Kort for over an hour, but he subsequently died at 3:33 pm.",ed,,11,,,

It is dark when Officer Hensley sees a dark blue Ford Explorer driving in the 800 block of Dawson without headlights or a front license plate. Officer Hensley stopped this vehicle on N. Monumental at E. Houston. 

The Defendant, Gene Franklin, was found to be driving this vehicle. As Officer Hensley approached the driver's window he sees the Defendant drinking from a Gatorade bottle.

 Officer Hensley sees the Defendant move his right hand up to his mouth before complying with his directives. The Defendant exits the vehicle, and drops what later tests positive as cocaine and the key to the vehicle. 

The Defendant is handcuffed without incident and placed in the back seat of Officer Hensley's patrol vehicle. Officer Hensley asks the Defendant several times if he swallowed any drugs or anything else, offering him (Gene Franklin) medical aid if he has done so. The Defendant denies having done so. The Defendant does not mention feeling bad nor does he ask for medical attention. 

Officer Hensley requests canine to check the vehicle, then orders a wrecker and the Defendant's vehicle is impounded. Officer Hensley then brings the Defendant directly to the main station at 214 W.

Mississippi in reference to a fight call. Officers were already on a call at 205 S. Mississippi in reference to a Kidnaping/Assault and were just finishing up when the call of an assault in progress came in. 

Officer Dunn advised his partner, Officer Bledsoe that he was going to check outside to see if he could hear anything. Officer Dunn observed a white female walking across the street to the address the fight call was reported to have occurred. 

Officer Dunn walked to the residence at 209 S. Mississippi and observed, through a window of the residence, an altercation going on. Officer Dunn saw a white male subject, later identified as Randy McSmith, w/m, DOB 06/10/61, assaulting the white female that had been walking across the street, identified as Betty Gail Odom, w/f. 

Officer Dunn called for backup as he was advised the suspect possibly had a knife. When his backup arrived they entered the residence from the south door to the kitchen and made contact with the suspect, McSmith, and ordered him down to the ground at gunpoint. 

The suspect did not comply with officers commands. Officer Dunn holstered his duty weapon and drew his tazer. McSmith continued to ignore the officers orders to get down. McSmith however did raise his hands up and at this time Officer Dunn grabbed the suspect by his right arm and did a leg sweep to make the suspect go to the ground. 

McSmith went down on all fours and was pushed the rest of the way down to the ground and handcuffed. Officers advised McSmith was not injured and did not strike his head as he was forced down and handcuffed. McSmith was taken out of the house and placed in a patrol unit parked nearest the residence. 

The in-car video was on during the time the suspect was placed in this unit. McSmith appeared to be intoxicated and altered his moods from polite to agitated and then to cussing the officer. Due to the call being assigned to Officer Dunn and Officer Bledsoe, McSmith was transferred from Officer Sanders' vehicle to theirs. 

Officer Bledsoe moved McSmith from one unit to the other and McSmith became very uncooperative. McSmith did not want to be patted down and continued to jerk away and used abusive language at officers. McSmith was placed in the back driver's side seat of the patrol vehicle and the door was shut. As soon as the door was shut McSmith began kicking the door and window of the patrol vehicle. 

Officer Dunn immediately opened the door to prevent damage and to take control
of McSmith. Officer Dunn and Officer Milhollen got inside the back seat and were on top of McSmith to hold him down while leg restraints could be placed on him. McSmith continued to kick and buck up and down as this was being done. Officer Dunn explained that while holding McSmith down, McSmith tried to bite him. At this time Officer Dunn gave McSmith a forearm strike across the left side of McSmiths head. McSmith at that time quit trying to bite Officer Dunn. The leg restraints were put on McSmith and was seat belted in. The door was shut again. Officer Dunn said he heard a loud bang after the door was shut. Other witnesses that were about 25 feet away saw McSmith using the left side of his head to hit the window numerous times. 

Officers rolled down the window and held McSmith until a Redman helmet arrived and was placed on him. McSmith was transported to Potter County Detention Center to be booked in on the charges of Assault Domestic Violence and Resisting Arrest. McSmith continued to cuss officers during transportation to Potter County Detention Center. Upon arriving at PCDC McSmith was removed from the vehicle and put on the ground, as he was still being difficult. 

Potter County officers came out and assisted in escorting McSmith into the booking room. The Redman helmet was taken off and once in the booking room he is checked and they notice a small amount of blood coming from McSmiths left ear. PCDC Medical Officer refused McSmith being booked in until he was cleared medically by the hospital. 

McSmith was transported to NWTH-ER and examined. Dr. Hudson checks his eyes, ears, nose, throat and his left ankle. McSmith was found to have facial contusion and a sprained ankle. McSmith was medically released to return to the Detention Center. McSmith was escorted back to Officer Dunn and Bledsoe's patrol unit. Officer Dunn advises McSmith is not cooperating during them trying to get his seat belt on and spits on Officer Dunn. At the time this occurred McSmith only had handcuffs on. Officer Dunn states he uses his forearm to slide across McSmiths left side of his face to point his head in the opposite direction so the seat belt could be placed on him. 

They decide to put the Redman helmet back on McSmith due to his uncooperative state. McSmith is then taken back to Potter County Detention Center.

During the transport back to Potter County Detention Center McSmith is still being somewhat disorderly. At about the I-40/287 split McSmith gets quiet and appears to have fell asleep. When they enter the sally port at the PCDC, Officer Bledsoe goes into booking to get another officer to assist. McSmith appears to be passed out and has to be dragged in by Officer Dunn and Potter County Officer Hudson. 

McSmith still has the Redman helmet on at this time. McSmith is taken to the booking room and Medical Officer Cole checks on him. Medical Officer Cole is advised the hospital has released McSmith. When McSmiths name is called he grunts and shook his head. 

Medical Officer Cole accepts McSMith and they drag him to the detox cell #175 where he is strip-searched. McSmith is strip-searched due to the fact that a knife was reportedly used during the assault he had been involved in and the knife was not recovered. McSmith had urinated in his pants and his clothes were not put back on after the strip search. 

This was due to his intoxicated state and the officers were unable to put them back on. McSmith is in the cell by himself and is laid down on his left side in case he vomited. At this time it is approximately 0130 hrs. McSmith is left in the cell alone at this time.

Officers with PCDC check on McSmith numerous times throughout the rest of the morning and report him to be sleeping and snoring with no movement from where he was laid down in the beginning. Dayshift officers arrived at 08:00 am and McSmith was still asleep with normal breathing. 

Around 0900 hrs Potter County Officer Daniel hears McSmith having labored breathing. Officer Daniel checks on McSmith and notices McSmith lying in a small puddle of vomit. Officer Daniel moves McSmith to where his head is over the floor grate that covers the drain. 

Officer Daniel reports McSmith as being very cold to the touch. The Medical Officer was called to check on McSmith. McSmith was taken to Medical and an ambulance called due to his unresponsive state. The ambulance transported McSmith to NWTH and it was diagnosed that McSmith had a subdurmal hematoma and needed to have surgery to relieve the pressure. 

Dr. Gentry performed brain surgery to relieve the pressure on Wednesday 02/28/07. The injury had occurred on the left side of McSmiths head. This is the same side of the head Officer Dunn struck with his forearm and the same side of the head McSmith himself was banging against the window of the patrol car. On March 1, 2007 McSmith died from  complications of his injuries. 

An autopsy was performed by Dr. Beavers at the Lubbock M.E.s office. The preliminary autopsy results indicate blunt force trauma to the head with other significant conditions: Cirrhosis, arteriosclerosis, and hypertension. The preliminary results of narcotics in his system showed him to have cocaine in his system. 

There were also barbiturates and opiates but due to his surgery this would not be uncommon. McSmith had been in an altercation with Betty Odom at her residence earlier that Tuesday evening. The house had furniture turned over, a TV broken in the floor and a coffee table broken. 

McSmith then had an altercation with Betty at the residence across the street. It is unknown if during these two altercations McSmith head was struck or if he fell on anything. It is known that Officer Dunn struck McSmith on the left side of his head to prevent from being bitten and McSmith himself was banging his head against the window of the patrol car. 

The surgeon, Dr. Gentry and pathologist, Dr. Beavers could not determine which one of the events would have caused the injury or if both caused the injury. However the cirrhosis of the liver would cause the blood veins to be in a weaken state to compound any injury that might have occurred",ed,,,,,

After remand, lawsuit dismissed: 2/26/2016","On January 14, 2010 at approximately 1:30am, officers with the Mesquite Police department were dispatched to 4808 Via Ventura in Mesquite in regards to a burglary in progress. Upon their arrival, they contacted the courtesy officer of the apartment complex that the suspect, Gregory Kitchen, was in custody. During questioning of Mr. Kitchen, he stated that he was alone in his apartment with his two children (ages 3 and 1).

He stated that his wife was out of town and he was ""horny"". He stated that he decided to check out different apartments that he knew were occupied by women to see if he could get a ""booty call."" 

He told officers that he thought that the women were inviting him in since their lights were on. After going to a couple of different apartments he found one that the front door was unlocked. He told officers that he had then entered the apartment and asked the female inside if she wanted a ""booty call"". 

Officer's arrested Mr. Kitchen. They had then found his children, alone in the apartment with the door unlocked and had been in the apartment for a lengthy time period.

 He was then transported to the Mesquite Police Department and placed in their jail. On January 15, 2010, Mr. Kitchen was transferred to the Dallas County Jail. On January 21, 2010 at approximately 11:45pm, DSO Wigley observed Mr. Kitchen in his cell crying. DSO Wigley observed that it appeared that Mr. Kitchen had vomited on his jail clothing and was pacing in an upset manner hitting his head on the door of the cell and walls. 

Mr. Kitchen told DSO Wigley that he was upset because during visitation his wife had told him that she was going to leave him. DSO Wigley asked Mr. Kitchen if he felt like hurting himself and Mr. Kitchen stated yes. DSO Wigley then contacted LVN Jean Brown who advised him that she would come to the 4th floor Nurse's Station and talk with Mr. Kitchen. 

DSO Wigley then had Mr. Kitchen change jail clothing and then escorted him to the nurse's station. LVN Brown was seated behind the desk when Mr. Kitchen entered the nurse's station. At this time, Mr. Kitchen made a dash around the desk and pinned LVN Brown to her seat.

Mr. Kitchen then started groping the nurse's breast and pulling at her scrubs. DSO's then restrained Mr. Kitchen using restraint holds and pressure points and finally got him to let go of LVN Brown.(see offense #10-009836) 

On January 22, 2010 at approximately 2:35pm, Detention Service Officers and a nurse were on 2 West in regards to an inmate in tank 2WL09. While there, Mr. Kitchen, in tank 2WL05, began banging on the door of his cell. Detention Service Officers opened the door of the tank and Mr. Kitchen became combative with them and began fighting with them. 

He was removed from the tank and he was taken to the floor for his and their safety. At this time, Mr. Kitchen became unresponsive and appeared he had lost consciousness. Medical Staff were called who arrived and began providing Mr. Kitchen with CPR. Paramedics with the Dallas Fire Department arrived and transported Mr. Kitchen to Parkland Memorial Hospital. At 3:26pm, Detention Service Supervisor's were contacted and advised that Mr. Kitchen had been pronounced deceased by Dr. Kimberly King at PMH.

She said the person may have been on drugs, and he was screaming unintelligible speech. 

Officer C. G. Phillips, riding unit 14D02N, was dispatched to the location at 2313 hours regarding a suspicious event call. Officer Hutson, riding unit 14D3N, agreed to check by at 2314 hours. 

Officer K. Hutson was the first patrol unit to arrive on Westover at 2315 hours. Once Officer Hutson arrived, two unknown black females pointed him in the direction that the victim had taken. Officer Hutson drove down the street and another citizen pointed to the direction that the victim had taken on Belgard. Officer Hutson then located Darrell Lauderdale in a ditch in the 5900 block of Vasser and notified the dispatcher. 

Sergeant Phillips, while still enroute, heard Officer Hutson on the radio as he informed the dispatcher Lauderdale was on Vasser. Officer Hutson noticed that Lauderdale was taking off his pants. He then tried to climb through a fence and trees, and stated someone tried to get him in his house. Officer Hutson helped the irrational Lauderdale out of the ditch and placed handcuffs on him for both their safety. Officer D. L. Garcia, Unit 14D31N, checked by and arrived. 

At 2319 hours, Sgt. Phillips arrived at the location noticing that Officers Hutson and Garcia had Lauderdale in custody. Officer Hutson walked the staggering Lauderdale to Officer Garcia's vehicle and noted that he exhibited signs of intoxication from an unknown substance. Lauderdale was detained for public intoxication by Officer Hutson and transported to 5938 Westover by Officer Garcia. 

Officer Hutson then took Lauderdale out of Officer Garcia's car and placed him in his patrol car. Lauderdale told Officer Hutson that he had smoked weed earlier that night. 

Officer Hutson was then approached by Derwin Lauderdale, the twin brother of Darrell Lauderdale. Derwin Lauderdale verified his brother's birth date. Officer Hutson also noted that Darrell Lauderdale had minor scratches on his chest. 

Officer Hutson transported Darrell Lauderdale to Southeast Jail at 8300 Mykawa at 2334 hours, and arrived at 2336 hours. As Officer Hutson pulled in the sally port area, Darrell Lauderdale started kicking the back door of the patrol car. After parking the car, Officer Hutson opened the passenger rear door. Lauderdale rolled out of the vehicle onto the ground. Lauderdale began rolling around screaming, ""Please don't shoot me."" 

Officer Hutson summoned the help of jail medical personnel, and clinic assistant Sameer Merchant responded and notified Dr. Chellaram. Dr. Chellaram checked Lauderdale's pulse and told Officer Hutson to call HFD to check him, and he did so. Jail Sergeants Wolter and Loessin then went to the sally port and monitored the situation while an ambulance was enroute. Lauderdale continued to roll around kicking his legs wildly. At the request of Dr. Chellaram, a gurney was brought to the location. Once Lauderdale was placed on the gurney he started to calm down. Dr. Chellaram placed a cuff on his arm to monitor his blood pressure. Officer Hutson took off the handcuffs. Officer Huston said that Dr. Chellaram stated that Lauderdale was not breathing. 

Clinic personnel started CPR on Lauderdale while Officer Hutson contacted the dispatcher to inform HFD that Lauderdale had stopped breathing. A few minutes later an ambulance arrived and started working on Lauderdale and noted that he had a pulse. Lauderdale's pulse stopped and HFD personnel continued CPR. HFD transported Lauderdale to Ben Taub Hospital followed by Officer Salsedo. Officer Salsedo notified Officer Huston that Lauderdale was pronounced dead at the hospital at 0103 hours.",ed,,6,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/91166e6ec252439eb6affde528630532.jpg,"56,13,442,470"

From appeal:
We have found no case addressing all of the uses of force at issue here—which include tightening handcuffs until they left deep furrows in Casey's wrists, shocking him with a taser approximately eighteen times, dropping him at least twice, striking his head against a door and a brick wall, hog-tying him, and pulling his head and neck backwards while applying 740 pounds of compressive force. We nevertheless consider it self-evident that, for example, no reasonable officer would believe that the use of force Young describes below was constitutional:

Q. At the time that we are talking about [i.e., after Young first shot Casey with the darts from the taser], Joel Don Casey had his face down in the couch; isn't that right?
A: Yes, sir, he did.
Q. All it would take was for you two officers to come over here and put your hands on him and keep him in that position; isn't that right? That is one of your options?
A. In theory.
Q. But you are continuing to taser him; isn't that true?
A. I continued to dry tase him because he wasn't just standing still. It wasn't like I was just dry tasing him. He was letting me tase him.
Q. You are not telling this jury that it was a fight because a man is being shocked with electricity that his body is involuntarily moving, are you?
A. That is exactly what I am saying.

No reasonable officer could believe that the constitution permits a law enforcement
officer to use pain compliance measures to stop someone who is mentally ill from flinching
in response to electric shock... Moreover, the jury watched a videotaped reenactment of Gehring, Young, Cavitt, and Thomas restraining another deputy who was playing the part of Casey. Because the
County prepared the reenactment, the deputies depicted their own versions of their actions.
They did not repeatedly shock, drop, and strike the head of the person playing the part of
Casey; Cavitt did not place his knee directly on the man‘s neck; and of course, Casey‘s role
was played by someone who knew who the other participants were, what they proposed to
do, and why. Despite these advantages, the deputy playing Casey‘s part was placed in so
much pain that the reenactment had to be aborted.",This death does not appear in the Office of Attorney General Office database.,ed,,"2,3,6,1",,custody_deaths/images/deaths/0f4a3a3488254454967286db79588a79.jpg,"39,4,432,469"

THIS CASE DOES NOT APPEAR IN OAG DATABASE

The decedent had a medical history of paranoid schizophrenia; his prior psychotic
episodes were frequently associated with aggressive behavior. His schizophrenia
had historically been controlled to some extent by medication. The decedent’s
actions during the terminal events indicate an exacerbation of psychosis. The
actions of others in attempting to subdue the decedent exacerbated the psychosis,
leading to a state of delirium. The decedent’s aggressive behavior, “superhuman
strength"", and lack of response to painful stimuli are all features that have been
associated with the “excited delirium syndrome”.

In contrast to that syndrome, however, the decedent was not under the influence of any stimulant substances. No controlled substances of any type were detected in a postmortem screen of the
decedent’s blood. A very low (subtherapeutic) level of ziprasidone (an
antipsychotic medication) was detected in his postmortem blood sample. The
injuries the decedent sustained in the terminal struggle did not per se contribute to
his death. 

The mechanism of death in this case is likely related to automatic
stimulation during this psychotic episode. The manner of death derives from the
events leading up to the death; the actions of others, regardless of intent, clearly
exacerbated the psychotic delirium. 

Therefore, but for the actions of others, it is unlikely this man would have died at the time he did. The manner of death will be listed as homicide.",This case does not appear in the Office of the Attorney General database.,ed,,"1,2,3,6",,custody_deaths/images/deaths/2a9c8b374fdc4508bd72f0c3c5955b47.jpg,"69,41,432,471"

intersection of FM 490 and FM 493 in Hargill, Texas. The nature of the call was regarding a male subject armed with a two-by-four (wooden stick) striking windows of a business, P&L Store, and parked vehicles. Upon arrival, deputies located several subjects holding down on the ground a male suspect identified as Noel Davila 26 years old. The subjects were identified as Noel Davila's family members including his mother, Emma Delia Davila who stated that Noel was under the influence of drugs. Deputies arrested Noel Davila for public intoxication to prevent any injuries to himself or others.

Noel Davila was handcuffed and placed in a patrol unit and was transported to the Hidalgo County Detention Center, 711 El Cibolo Rd., Edinburg, Texas. During transport, Noel Davila was combative by kicking the patrol unit's door and protective cage. When the deputy arrived at the detention center, he discovered Noel Davila lying on the floorboard between the rear seat and the protective cage. 

Detention officers assisted the deputy in taking Davila out of the patrol unit. Davila was unable to stand on his own two feet and was assisted to the pat down cell. While Davila was lying down in the cell, detention officers noticed Davila was bleeding from a laceration over his left eye. The detention center's on-duty nurse was notified and she did a quick assessment of Davila's injury. The nurse noted the laceration over Davila's left eye and that he was responsive to verbal stimuli. 

Davila's eyes were dilated with minimal reaction to light and he showed symptoms of intoxication. During the assessment, Davila had to be restrained by the detention officers as he made attempts to jerk his arms and body towards the nurse. The nurse requested that Davila to be taken to the hospital to have the laceration attended to and to be evaluated for medical clearance for incarceration. Detention officers placed Davila, who was unable to walk on his own, into a detention unit and transported Davila to Edinburg Hospital. During transport Davila was mumbling and then became unresponsive.

Upon arrival, Davila was examined by hospital medical staff and declared dead. Lab results of Davila's blood revealed the presence of cocaine and alcohol. An autopsy was performed by a medical pathologist who revealed the preliminary cause of death to be cardio respiratory arrest while under influence of cocaine with cocaine psychosis and hyperthermia.",,,8,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/18fbe6b2911a4be68bebccb6ab9d1b45.jpg,"60,17,453,482"

Even after she was restrained, in handcuffs, the female reportedly continued to resist officers. After the assistance of more officers on the scene, the female was placed into the rear seat of a Beaumont Police vehicle and additionally restrained with hobbles, and transported to the Jefferson County Detention Center.

Officer Wilson and Fowler are shown on detention center video arriving at 8:22:08 pm, in the sally port. Video and reports depict several correctional personnel assisting the officers in taking the unidentified black female from the patrol vehicle. It's apparent, on video, that she is resisting officers as they entered the facility. The booking medical staff (EMT Mark Boozer) is also escorting the female into the facility. Officers report taking the female to the female dress-out room, which is standard policy for unruly persons, so they can be immediately searched and put into a jail uniform. This is shown on jail video.

Female Correctional Officers Nobles and Calcote attempted to search and change the female into a uniform. Because of her uncooperative actions male Officers Miller, Gardner, McKeever and Sgt. Mills soon assisted them. EMT Boozer was also reported to be present. The female was very combative, including biting at officers, and the officers were not able to change her into jail clothing. (Note: there's not a camera that covers the change-out area). The decision was made to further restrain the female, by Sgt. Mills and additional restraints were added.

This included a belly-chain and leg iron, according to reports. The female was then taken to an isolation cell (B-06) in booking. She is shown to resist movement from the change out room to the isolation cell on jail video and the additional restraints are also visible. According to officers reports, Sgt. Mills made the decision to further restrain the female by securing her to the bench and floor, in a sitting position, in cell B-06. This is accomplished by using a device called a T-bar, which aids in securing the restraints to eyelets in the floor and bench. 

Sgt. Mills reported that the female continued to resist their instructions and again tried to bite officers that were trying to restrain her. EMT Boozer was also in the cell. Sgt. Mills reported that he made the decision to deploy his department issued Taser in a contact fashion (drive stun) to the female's torso. He stated that this was used as a pain compliance technique. According to reports, officers were able to apply the mentioned restraints, as the female calmed slightly. The isolation cell door was closed, while the female continued to scream and be disruptive. The female was in the isolation cell by herself. (Note: There's not a camera that covers the interior of the isolation cells).

Officers are shown on the booking video to routinely check on the female as they passed by the isolation cell. The cell has a solid steel door with a viewing window. In addition, there is a large viewing window to the right of the door. The female restrained to the bench would be clearly visible, through the side window, to passing officers. 

At 10:50:53 pm the cell door was opened after an officer viewing the female thought that something wasn't normal with her appearance. It was found that she was unresponsive and not breathing. EMT Boozer began CPR and an ambulance was called. Correction officers and additional medical personnel from the jail assisted EMT Boozer. An ambulance arrived and transported the female to Christus St. Elizabeth Hospital in Beaumont, TX where she was pronounced dead at 11:58 pm. Originally the female refused to give officers her name. She was entered into the jail as Jane Doe. 

Through investigation, it was determined that her name was Shmekia R. Lewis from Fort Polk, Louisiana. Her identify was confirmed by numerous scars, numerous tattoos and photographs from a previous arrest at another agency. Lewis' positive ID was confirmed on the next date with the comparison of fingerprints. I requested that Justice of the Peace Vi McGinnis order an autopsy at the Jefferson County Morgue. I had officers remain with the decedent until she was released to B.J. Transport, to be taken to the morgue.",,,,,,

Norman opened the driver door of the vehicle and observed Mr. Green take a drink of water as he was chewing. 

Sgt. Norman ordered Mr. Green to place his hands on the steering wheel but after refusing Sgt. Norman sprayed him in the face with pepper spray. Mr. Green failed to comply with Sgt. Normans orders so at that time Sgt. Norman used his Taser gun and driver stunned Mr. Green in the shoulder. Mr. Green still failed to comply with Sgt. Normans orders so Sgt. Norman again drive stunned him in the shoulder and this time Mr. Green complied with the orders and got out of the vehicle and laid flat on his stomach.

Mr. Green was ordered to spit out what he was chewing but failed to comply with the order and was drive stunned with the Taser in order to get him to comply. However, Mr. Green failed to comply and continued chewing. Officer Drey arrived on the scene and handcuffed Mr. Green while he was lying on the ground. Mr. Green was then escorted to Officer Drey's patrol vehicle. Mr. Green was coherent and answering Officer Dreys questions. Officer Drey placed Mr. Green in the back seat of his patrol vehicle with another prisoner Officer Drey had arrested just prior to checking by with Sgt. Norman.

As Officer Drey neared the jail with the prisoners Mr. Green stated, ""I'm going to die."" Mr. Green began shaking and convulsing. Officer Drey was just seconds from the jail and requested an ambulance to meet him at the jail. When Officer Drey arrived at the jail Mr. Green slumped over in the seat and became unconscious. The ambulance arrived and transported Mr. Green to Bayshore Hospital. Mr. Green arrived at the hospital at 1:11 am and was placed on life support. He was pronounced dead at 9:50 am on 11/21/05.

Management located at 1121 Riverside, Fort Worth, TX. Officer Birley's duties consisted of parking his
personal vehicle at the front entrance of Waste Management and preventing unauthorized persons and vehicles from entering the property. There is a large No Trespassing sign on the front entrance gate that is clearly visible from the street. 

At approximately 2030 hours Officer Birley observed a Maroon 2004 Dodge Stratus, two-door enter the property, which Officer Birley did not recognize as an employees vehicle. Officer Birley motioned for the vehicle to stop. The vehicle continued forward passing Officer Birley, who then yelled for the driver (later identified as Hammock, Eric) to stop. Hammock continued into the parking lot area and disappeared from sight. A short time later Hammocks vehicle appeared and proceeded towards the exit/entrance. Officer Birley again motioned for the vehicle to stop, which continued past Officer Birley with the drivers side window down. Officer Birley yelled at Hammock to stop. Hammock continued to drive by, and exited the property. Officer Birley followed Hammock in his personnel vehicle while calling out on the radio for assistance.

Hammock drove his vehicle into a field where it became stuck. Hammock exited and fled on foot. Officer Birley pursued, continually identifying himself as a police officer and ordering Hammock to stop. Hammock did not yield to Birley's commands and proceeded into the back yard of a residence where Birley was able to catch him. Officer Birley grabbed Hammock's hand and attempted to take him into custody for Criminal Trespass and Evading Arrest or Detention. Hammock pulled his arm away and tried to strike Officer Birley with his hand. Officer Birley deployed and fired his Taser, striking Hammock in the chest area. Hammock fell to the ground, but was not completely incapacitated. Hammock pulled the Taser probes out and started to run away from Officer Birley, still not complying with Birley's commands. 

During the altercation, Officer Birley utilized his Taser in a drive stun mode and fired one additional set of probes at Hammock to assist in the arrest, which had little effect. Additional officers arrived and Hammock continued to resist by keeping his hands underneath his body. Officers were able to handcuff Hammock and sit him up. 

Officers noticed that Hammock had labored breathing and his skin was turning pale. Hammock was placed on his back and Med Star was requested. Officers observed Hammock stop breathing just prior to Med Star and Fire personnel arriving. Med Star and Fort Worth Fire personnel responded to the scene and performed lifesaving measures on Hammock. Hammock was transported to John Peter Smith Hospital and did not recover.

Officers contacted the complainant, who told Officers that the white male was talking incoherently and had attempted to kick their door in. Officers observed a footprint on the door the white male had kicked it. Complainant had called a male friend to come over to her house, as she was afraid of the white male in her yard. 

The male friend of the complainant arrived and confronted the white male. He told him he needed to leave. The white male became aggressive toward the friend, who then grabbed a tire iron from his trunk, to defend himself, if needed. When someone said the police were on the way, the white male left the area.

Officers began checking the area on foot, when they were told that the white male subject was walking on Lamar St., a block over from where they were. One Officer proceeded to the area of Lamar St. while the other checked the area on foot. Officer was contacted by a Hispanic male, who told the Officer that the suspicious white male was in his backyard. Officer contacted the suspicious white male in the backyard. The Officer observed the white male to be speaking incoherently. 

When the Officer attempted to speak with the white male, he became aggressive, in his actions toward the Officer. The white male charged toward the Officer and the Officer deployed his Taser, striking the white male. After the Taser deployment, the white male pulled one of the probes out and took off running from the Officer. 

The Officer began a foot chase with the subject. The white male ran into Whitworth St., running into the side of a moving vehicle traveling west on Whitworth St. Officer tackled the white male and tried to restrain him. The white male continued to resist the Officer. 

A back up unit arrived and attempted to help the other Officer gain control and place the white male into custody. The white male continued to resist, striking one Officer in the mouth with his fist, and kicking the other Officer in the groin. Officers continued to wrestle with the white male for several minutes. 

Officers' drive stunned the white male several times until the white male grabbed the Officer's Taser and broke it. Officers called for additional Officers' help, while struggling with the white male. Officers were finally able to get the white male in a prone position and handcuffed before other units arrived. Officers got the white male subject to his feet and escorted him to a patrol unit to be transported to Hopkins County Sheriff's Office. 

The white male was still talking incoherently about someone being raped. Officers transported the white male subject to the Sheriff's Office, who Officers notified that they would need a V-cell, a cell for inmates who are violent and could harm themselves or others. Upon arrival to the Sheriff's Office, Officers escorted the white male subject to the V-cell and placed him inside the cell. Officers attempted to remove the white male's clothing. The white male began resisting Officers again. 

Sulphur Springs Police Department Officers', along with a couple of Deputies, attempted to gain control of the white male and remove his clothing. The white male was drive stunned a few times, while in the cell, in an attempt to get him compliant with Officers. Once the white male's clothes were removed, Officers exited the V-cell, one a time, with the last Officer taking the handcuffs of the white male subject, then backing out of the cell and closing the door. The last Officer out of the cell observed the white male subject to be breathing, moaning, in the prone position on the floor, when the Officer backed out. Officers were in the V-Cell approximately 3 minutes. 

Officers then attended to their injuries and began the book in process. The Patrol Lieutenant looked in on the white male a couple of times during the book in. The Officer, at the book in counter, heard a loud noise come from the V-cell area and went to the area thinking the white male subject may have become combative again. The Officer observed the Patrol Lieutenant looking in the door window at the white male subject. The Officer looked in as well and told the Lieutenant that the white male subject was lying in the same position they had left him in, approximately 10 minutes prior.

Officers had a jailer come and unlock the cell. Officers checked the white male subject for a pulse and the white male subject had a weak pulse. Officers called for EMS to respond. EMS arrived, loaded subject in the ambulance and began CPR enroute to the hospital. The white male subject regained his heartbeat, but was not breathing on his own. The white male subject was transferred to a Tyler hospital the next day, Saturday.

While officers were attempting to gain control of Delacruz, he was able to gain control of one officers pepper spray.

 The pepper spray was able to be taken away from Delacruz. Delacruz then attempted to take one of the officer's duty pistol but was unsuccessful. During the struggle before Delacruz was secured a Taser drive stun was applied for pain compliance. After a brief struggle, Delacruz was placed into handcuffs and secured for his safety.

The initial 911 call involved a man with a gun with possible shots fired. During the initial encounter, Mr. Castillo-Gongora was non-compliant to all verbal commands. Castillo-Gongora ran into the roadway away from officers and stopped in the median. 

Castillo-Gongora knelt down and reached into his pocket and pulled out his cell phone. Castillo-Gongora then appeared to give up. As deputies approached to handcuff Castillo-Gongora, he became very combative and resisted. At this point, Castillo-Gongora was tased by Trooper John Horton. Castillo-Gongora continued to resist and went back into the roadway.

Castillo-Gongora was tased again by Trooper John Horton. It took numerous officers to subdue
Castillo-Gongora and place him in handcuffs. Even after handcuffs were applied, Castillo-Gongora continued to resist by kicking toward the officers.

Emailed sheriff@co.walker.tx.us January 31 and 3/20","On Friday, 6/16/06 at approx. 2:57 pm Deputy Watson conducted a traffic stop in reference to a seat belt violation on a vehicle bearing Texas license plate (redacted) in the area of the 400 block of Hwy 75 North, Huntsville, Walker County, Texas. The vehicle actually stopped in a parking lot located off of Kevin Williams Road, which is located just off of Hwy 75 North. The vehicle was driven by a black male and there were three black female passengers in the vehicle. This traffic stop was recorded by Deputy Watson's in car video system. 

Deputy Watson exited his patrol vehicle and made contact with the driver of the vehicle, who was identified as Courtenay Jermaine O'Bryant, b/m, DOB: 09/08/1980. Deputy Watson identified himself and explained the reason he had made the traffic stop. Deputy Watson asked C. O'Bryant for his driver's license and then asked ""what's in your hand?"" 

Deputy Watson stated, ""that's cocaine"", ""get out of the vehicle."" Deputy Watson brought C. O'Bryant out of the vehicle and began to try to handcuff C. O'Bryant. C. O'Bryant was resisting Deputy Watson during this time. C. O'Bryant asked Deputy Watson what he was doing and Deputy Watson replied ""you have cocaine all over your lap."" 

David Rivera exited the patrol vehicle and assisted Deputy Watson in placing C. O'Bryant in steel hand restraints. After C. O Bryant was placed into steel hand restraints Deputy Watson realized that C. O'Bryant had something white in his mouth and was chewing. Deputy Watson was positioned on C. O'Bryant's left side and David Rivera was positioned on C. O'Bryant's right side. Deputy Watson was holding onto C. O'Bryant's left arm and David Rivera was holding onto C. O'Bryant's right arm. Deputy Watson placed his left arm on C. O'Bryant's throat and his right hand on the back of C. O'Bryant's neck and ordered him to spit it out. 

David Rivera had his right arm in the area of C. O'Bryant's lower stomach and his left hand in the area of C. O'Bryant's right shoulder. Deputy Watson and David Rivera leaned C. O'Bryant over the trunk of C. O'Bryant's vehicle and Deputy Watson repeatedly stated ""spit it out."" Some of the substance in C. O'Bryant's mouth fell onto the trunk lid of C. O'Bryant's vehicle. C. O'Bryant began to lick up the substance that had come out of his mouth. This lasted approx. 30 seconds. 

At this time David Rivera and Deputy Watson took C. O'Bryant toward Deputy Watson's patrol vehicle and placed C. O'Bryant on the ground. Deputy Watson continued to state ""spit it out."" C. O'Bryant advised that he had spit it all out. Deputy Watson and David Rivera stood C. O'Bryant up near the front passenger side quarter panel of Deputy Watson's patrol vehicle.

C. O'Bryant asked Deputy Watson what he was arresting him for and Deputy Watson advised Possession of Controlled Substance and Tampering with Evidence. Deputy Watson performed a search of C. O'Bryant's person and then placed him in the back seat of his patrol vehicle. Deputy Watson returned to C. O'Bryant's vehicle to continue with the traffic stop and David Rivera remained near the back door of Deputy Watson's patrol vehicle. Deputy Watson took possession of some pieces of off-white substance that C. O'Bryant had spit out. Deputy Watson identified the black female passengers as Cheryl Lynn Biggs, DOB (redacted), Kasandra Ann Briggs
DOB (redacted), and Monica Guy DOB (redacted). 

It should be noted that during this time period, Terrion Dwayne O'Bryant, a relative of C. O'Bryant approached Deputy Watson's patrol vehicle and asked what was happening. Terrion O'Bryant works at the Huntsville City Service Center, which is located immediately south of the parking lot where the traffic stop occurred. Terrion O'Bryant observed C. O'Bryant in the back seat of the patrol vehicle and advised that he appeared to be fine.

Terrion O'Bryant was present when C. O'Bryant became distressed. At Friday 06/16/06 at approx. 3:11 PM David Rivera advised Deputy Watson that C. O'Bryant appeared to be in some type of distress. Deputy Watson immediately contacted dispatch and requested EMS to respond to the scene.
On Friday 06/16/06 at approx. 3:17 PM EMS arrived on scene and began treating C. O'Bryant. On Friday 06/16/06 at approx. 3:37 PM EMS transported C. O'Bryant to the Huntsville Memorial Hospital. On Friday 06/16/06 at approx. 03:42 PM EMS arrived at the Huntsville Memorial Hospital where he was treated by Dr.Antwi. On Friday June 16, 2006 at approx. 4:08 PM C. O'Bryant was pronounced deceased.

It should be noted that detective Charlies Perkins utilized a Scott Reagent field test kit and conducted a field test on a portion of the off white substance Deputy Watson had seized from the trunk lid of C. O'Bryant's vehicle. The Scott Reagent field test indicated positive for the presence of cocaine.",ab,wd,6,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/6543d96aa92849ab936be03be039712a.jpg,"86,6,395,371"

(said couldn't breathe while restrained on stomach)","On 7/3/2007, approx. 10:52 pm, Trooper Rodriguez saw a vehicle disregard the stop sign located at Broussard and FM 1732. He turned on his emergency lights to stop the driver for the violation. The suspect vehicle immediately turned into a private driveway, jumped out and started running westbound on foot while yelling ""NO."" Trooper Rodriguez pursued the suspect (later identified as David Gonzalez). Gonzalez ran into the backyard of a private residence. As Trooper Rodriguez caught up to Gonzalez, Gonzalez struck a 5 foot chain link fence that he apparently did not see due to the darkness. Gonzalez attempted to climb the fence as Trooper Rodriguez grabbed him. Gonzalez was able to get over the fence but was caught again by Trooper Rodriguez in which a struggle ensued. 

Gonzalez ran to several locations in an attempt to escape arrest only to be tackled again by Trooper Rodriguez. During the struggle, both Gonzalez and Trooper Rodriguez sustained numerous cuts and scratches. Trooper Rodriguez used verbal commands, mechanical arm bars, chemical
pepper spray and strikes on the legs and shoulders to gain submission without success. During the struggle, Gonzalez told Trooper Rodriguez, ""I'm not going back to jail."" Gonzalez managed to make it to the front yard of 7272 Parker St. before being brought to the ground again by Trooper Rodriguez. Due to Gonzalez' large size and muscular body, as well as possible drug use, Trooper Rodriguez was unable to place handcuffs on him.

The residents of 7272 Parker came outside, saw the struggle and helped Trooper Rodriguez handcuff
Gonzalez. The front yard was occupied by 2 pitbull dogs, and one of the pitbulls managed to get close enough to Gonzalez to bite him on the foot and calf before the owner was able to restrain the animal. Trooper Rodriguez called an ambulance for Gonzalez due to the dog bites and cuts from climbing the fence. While waiting for the ambulance, Trooper Rodriguez heard Gonzalez say that he couldn't breathe.

While Gonzalez was being watched by a Cameron Co. Deputy, Trooper Rodriguez went to retrieve his patrol unit. The Cameron Co. Deputy noticed that Gonzalez had stopped breathing. As Trooper Rodriguez arrived back to where Gonzalez was, he saw that the Deputy had uncuffed Gonzalez and rolled him on his back. Gonzalez was checked for a pulse and no pulse was found. Trooper Rodriguez and the Deputy were preparing to do CPR on Gonzalez, but the Paramedics arrived at that moment and they started CPR. Gonzalez was transported to Valley Regional Hospital in Brownsville where he was pronounced dead at 12:02 AM by the attending Physician. Trooper Rodriguez was also taken to Valley Regional Hospital by car where he received treatment for cuts on his arms and was examined for a strained left shoulder.",ab,wd,1,,,

As I
approached the Elmdale exit, I observed a white male running eastbound on IH-20 in the nude.
I went under the Elmdale overpass and came up the on ramp behind this subject with my lights and camera activated. I ordered the subject several times over the in car P.A. system to get off of the road. This subject refused to stop running and cut across both eastbound lanes of traffic without ever looking behind him for oncoming cars.

This subject crossed into the center median and started running eastbound in the westbound lanes.
I crossed through the center median and went in front of this subject. He then changed directions and crossed back through the center median and back across the eastbound lanes and started running westbound.

I then went approximately 50 yards in front of this subject and crossed back across the eastbound lanes and parked my patrol car facing towards him as he ran towards my car. I stepped out of the car and ordered him again to stop, this time the subject started to run faster as he went past my patrol car. I ran around the back of my car and tackled this subject.

Both the subject and myself fell to the ground and I attempted to gain control of his arms and place restraints on him. I managed to get one handcuff on his right wrist, but was unable to gain control of his left arm due to him having a hold of his right hand.

A passing motorist, Lori Alwine, stopped and assisted me by holding this subject's legs down while I attempted to secure his free arm. I instructed Ms. Alwine to cross his feet at the ankles and to press them up near his rear so that he could not kick her.

I then informed this subject to give me his hand or I was going to spray him. The only statement this subject ever stated was at this point and he stated spray me. I then administered approximately a half second burst of pepper spray from my state issued can of MK-3 aerosol pepper spray. I again ordered this subject to give me his arm and he complied with very little resistance.

After getting both restraints on and double locked, I asked Ms. Alwine to hold my handheld radio up over my head so I could contact Abilene and advise them that I had one in custody. Abilene Communications advised me that Abilene P.D. was en route and should be there at any time. Upon the arrival of Abilene Police Department Officer Stan Mieser, he assisted me in controlling this subject by holding his right arm while I was holding his left arm and relieving Ms. Alwine from holding his feet.

An unknown Taylor County deputy arrived and asked if we needed help. I asked this deputy if he had a set of leg irons that we could use and he stated yes. This deputy went and got his leg irons and placed them around the ankles of this subject.

Both myself and the deputy had to hold this subject's legs so that restraints could be placed on him.
I advised Officer Mieser that I had sprayed him and he called for an ambulance to be en route to us. After calling for the ambulance, myself and the Taylor County deputy stood with one foot on the chain of the leg irons while Officer Mieser secured the upper body until the ambulance arrived. Once the ambulance arrived, I observed them roll the subject onto his back and had the deputy place the restraints in front of him.

The ambulance crew then stated he was not breathing and started CPR on him. I then went and notified Sgt. John Land by cell phone that I had this subject in custody and that medical
personnel were working on him at this time due to him not breathing. Subject was placed into the ambulance and transported to Hendrick ER. I then waited for Sgt. Land to arrive before going to inventory this subjects vehicle. After inventorying the vehicle, I left for the Abilene District Office for debriefing by Sgt.

cause of death is per  pecos JP","On 11/24/2015 at around 9:30am, I Chief Deputy Thomas Perkins was on duty in Pecos County. I heard Deputy Rick Irigoyen get a call over the radio, of a reckless driver West of Fort Stockton on IH-10 in Pecos County. Dispatcher told Irigoyen that the driver had left his truck on the side of the road and took off walking.

As the Supervisor I started to head that way. Deputy Irigoyen said he had located the subject around the 245 MM on IH-10. I advised Irigoyen that I was on my way if he wanted to hold off, in case there was trouble.

Deputy Irigoyen told me by radio that he might have to take the subject down, as he was action strange and was walking out into IH-10. I advised him 10-4.I arrived at the location at approximately 9:43 am. Deputy Irigoyen and Deputy Dominguez was there. As I started to walk up to the location Deputy Irigoyen approached me and said he did not have to take him down that he complied with him. Deputy Irigoyen said he had an ambulance on the way. I walked up to the subject, who was sitting down on the ground. I could tell he was having trouble breathing and was sweating. The subject asked me if I was going to shoot him, I told him no. I could tell he was getting anxious was moving around, so I distanced myself from him. 

About that time Sgt. Tulon Murphy pulled up and then the subject started trying to stand up but couldn't. He then started to crawl towards the IH-10 white line. It was Thanksgiving Holiday and the traffic was heavy. As he crawled closed to the white line (fog line), I feared he was going to get himself or one of us run over from the heavy traffic. The subject was told to sit down and chill out. The subject was hollering the gun is over there the gun is over there. I observed that his eyes were rolling back in his head. 

Myself, Deputy Irigoyen, and Deputy Jessie Dominguez attempted to place handcuffs but the subject started to resist us. I and Sgt. Murphy grabbed the right arm, and Deputy Irigoyen and deputy Dominguez grabbed the left arm, two sets of cuffs were placed on him. I could hear the subject complain he could not breathe. I told the Deputies to get off of him, which Deputy Irigoyen did. Sgt. Murphy was telling him to take a deep breath and calm down. The male subject was hollering and was not making sense. I walked back to my patrol unit to see where EMS was and at that time they were pulling up.

EMS personal started to work on the subject and when they turned him over he was blue in the face and his eyes fixed. I again went to my patrol unit and advised the Sheriff's Office Dispatcher to get 601 (Sheriff) out here. EMS personal started CPR on the subject. Deputy Pete Galvan handed me the wallet, cap and cell phone that was on the ground next to him. I placed the items into an evidence bag.

Deputy Jessie Dominguez drove the ambulance to the Pecos County Hospital, as I followed. I contacted Texas Ranger Robert Losoya and advised him that we had a possible in custody death and explained to him what was going on. Texas Ranger Losoya said he would be on his way. I called 83rd Asst DA Bill Pharam and advised him what was going on. Once at the hospital I handed Deputy Ron Tucker the evidence bag with the subject's cell phone, cap and wallet. I also advised Tucker to take photographs and stay at the hospital until the Texas Rangers showed up.

This case was turned over to the Texas Rangers.",js,d,1,,,

MCSO Units, EMS and Fire Personnel responded and were advised the individual, later identified as Robert Lee Welch, DOB 01/14/1969, was pushing subjects on location but otherwise was not responding to family members. 

On arrival two Deputies approached Welch who was inside of a residence and not wearing clothing. The Deputies attempted to speak to Welch but he would not respond to them. The Deputies attempted to detain Welch and he began to resist. The struggle continued and Deputies had to deploy a Tazer to restrain and secure Welch. EMS was on scene and began treating Welch and discovered he was not breathing and did not have a pulse. 

EMS transported Welch to St. Lukes Hospital in Conroe where he was pronounced dead. The body was taken to the Southeast Texas Forensic Center in Conroe for autopsy. MCSO Major Crimes Unit, Texas Rangers and the District Attorneys Office were called to the scene to complete an investigation. That investigation is ongoing. The case will be referred to the Montgomery County District Attorneys Office for presentation to the Grand Jury. Following the scene investigation each officer was interviewed by Texas Ranger Sgt. David Rainwater and Detective Landrum, MCSO. Statements were collected from all four officers and held as part of the investigation.

Manner: Alcohol/Drug intoxication
Death Reason: medical condition and injuries","On 9/17/2007 at or about 0900 hours I, Sergeant Investigator Donny R. Whitaker was advised of a possible homicide on County Road 5742 in the Medina West Subdivision. I was advised that our deputies were out with a subject who had been wielding an axe and said he chopped up his wife.
While I was in route to this call I heard Deputy Joe Pedroza advise dispatch that he had a male subject
detained and to have EMS personnel respond to his location to check the subject out.

I arrived on scene at approximately 0922 hours. As I was exiting my vehicle I heard a male subject yelling but I was unable to understand what was being said. I proceeded to the residence in question, a single-wide mobile home located on the east side of County Road 5742.

I was walking up the driveway when I observed a male subject lying face down on the ground with his hands handcuffed behind his back. The male subject's ankles were tied together with what appeared to be tan gauze bandages that were then connected to the handcuffs. This male subject, later identified as Donald W. Jacobs, was yelling and thrashing around while he was lying on the ground. 

I then observed Deputy Pedroza, EMT Mike Farris, and a second EMT tending to Donald Jacobs.
Deputy Pedroza advised me that he and Deputy Virginio Garza had mad a quick walk through in the residence and found no other persons present. I walked to the back door, sliding glass doors, of the residence and started to enter when I observed a double headed axe lying on the back porch deck. I did not see any blood or body matter on the axe but did not move it for a closer inspection at the time.

I entered through the sliding glass doors, which entered into the kitchen and dining room area. Deputy Garza was in the kitchen attempting to locate prescription medications prescribed to Donald Jacobs. The kitchen and dining room were in disarray. It appeared as if soda and coffee had been spilled on the floor and a large puddle of water was observed on the kitchen cabinet. Soda and water had also been spilled on the dining room table.

I then began a cursory inspection of the residence. I traveled south through the residence from the kitchen. The next room I entered was the living room and I found no damages or items that appeared to be out of place. I then walked down a narrow hallway and found a small bedroom on the east side of the hallway. This bedroom appeared to be used as an office area as a desk and computer set up continued south in the hallway and came to a second room located on the east side of the hallway. 

This room had a large bed, chest of drawers, and television in it. Very little open space existed in this room but it was neat and in good order. The hallway then came to a dead end in a small bathroom. This bathroom was also in good order and no obvious damages were seen. I then returned to the kitchen and began checking the north end of the residence. A small wash or utility room
was located immediately north of the kitchen on the west side of the house. No damages were observed in this room. I then continued north into the master bedroom and bathroom. Both of these rooms were neatly kept and no damages were observed.

I then exited the residence and found Investigator Springer walking up the back porch. I advised Investigator Springer that I had found nothing so far and was going to check the two out buildings in the back yard area. We then went to the first out building. This building appeared to be a garage and workroom. I check the entire room but found no blood or other items to indicate a homicide had been committed. Investigator Springer then went to the ambulance to get a list of the medications that Donald Jacobs was taking. While Investigator Springer did this I went to the second out building. The second out building was a small metal storage building that contained lawn furniture.

I then started towards the ambulance when I observed another male subject walking in the yard. This subject said he was neighbor and friend to Donald. This subject, identified as Matthew Valentine explained that Donald has been under a great deal of stress and may not have been taking his medications. Matthew then explained that Donald is divorced and his ex wife lives in New Braunfels with their children. Matthew also said that Donald lives with his mother, Delores Jacobs at this location and that Donald's mother was currently at work.

Investigator Springer and I then entered the residence again in an attempt to find a telephone number or other means to contact Donald's ex wife and mother. Investigator Springer provided several telephone numbers to dispatch but they were unable to get an answer. Investigator Springer then had the New Braunfels Police Department contacted to have a welfare check performed.

We then exited the residence and were preparing to depart when Matthew asked if he could clean up the mess in the kitchen. Matthew explained that Donald's mother would be very upset if she returned home to find the mess in the kitchen. I advised Matthew to wait until the kitchen was photographed by Deputy Pedroza. I then heard EMT Mike Farris request an officer to make his location on Highway 90 at the bottom of the hill in Castroville to remove the handcuffs from Donald. Deputy Garza departed in route to that location. Investigator Springer then advised that he was going to Castroville.

I departed the scene a few minutes later and was driving into Castroville when I observed the ambulance and Deputy Garzas patrol car sitting on the shoulder of the roadway. I pulled in behind Deputy Garza's patrol car and observed Deputy Garza standing at the back of the ambulance and Investigator Springer exiting the rear doors of the ambulance. Investigator Springer motioned for me to exit my car. I exited my car and was informed that the EMTs were doing cardio pulmonary resuscitation on Donald. Investigator Springer then said that EMT Farris believed Donald had suffered a heart attack.

A short time later the ambulance departed the scene in route to the Wilford Hall Hospital. Investigator Springer spoke with our Chief Deputy, Dough Christian who advised us to go to the hospital.
We arrived at the hospital at 1046 hours. We were directed to trauma room 1 where we were told to wait outside for the doctor. A short time later we spoke with Dr. Michael Simpson. Dr. Simpson stated Donald was pronounced deceased at 1043 hours. Donald had no heart beat when he arrived at the hospital and had a temperature of 107 degrees. Dr. Simpson stated an autopsy would be performed by the Bexar County Medical Examiners Office.

We were provided with Donald's Wilford Hall Medical Number (98/003-42-4300) and Investigator Springer took custody of Donald's clothing prior to us leaving. We then departed the hospital and returned to the Medina County Sheriffs Office.",js,d,1,,,

http://www.everythinglubbock.com/news/kamc-news/county-releases-autopsy-of-man-tased-to-death After multiple requests and nearly a year of waiting, Lubbock County officials have released the autopsy of Donaciano Rendon.

Rendon was died after being tased multiple times by Lubbock County Sheriff's Deputies last September.

The autopsy, conducted by the Lubbock County Medical Examiner shortly after his death, says Rendon died of heart complications brought on by a physical altercation with law enforcement.

The report classifies his death as a homicide.

KAMC spoke with Rendon's widow, Ayda Sotelo, Thursday afternoon. She said she was shocked by some of the autopsy's findings.

""It's kind of funny how they say they didn't do anything wrong but the autopsy says different,"" Sotelo said.

The deputies involved in the incident were cleared by a grand jury but Sotelo said her husband was not a violent man and, she said, would not have resisted arrest.

The autopsy also made note of the multiple chemicals found in Rendon's body at the time of his death, including nicotine, alcohol and cocaine.","Tazed 2+ times

his knees were bent, such that his feet were by his buttocks. (Instrument No. 74-6 at 3). Deputy
Wilks then tied the hobble to Pratt’s ankles. (Instrument No. 74-3 at 5; 74-7 at 3). Deputy Salazar
testified that a hobble was deemed necessary because Pratt was such a large man, and was
uncooperative and out of control. (Instrument No. 74-4 at 4). According to Deputy Goldstein,
Pratt was mumbling incoherently during this time, and was on his stomach for one or two
minutes before the hobble was applied. ""

According to the deputies, the loose end of the hobble was held by Deputy Wilks, and
was not secured to the handcuffs. (Instrument Nos. 74-3 at 5; 74-6 at 3-4; 74-7 at 3).
Furthermore, multiple deputies testified that, while secured by the hobble, Pratt’s legs were
extended and flat. (Instrument No. 74-8 at 2). Deputy Lopez initially reported that the hobble
was attached to the handcuffs, but later testified that he only “assumed” that Deputy Wilks had

by a responding EMS paramedic and by the Internal Affairs Department (“IAD”), both of which
said that Pratt was “hog-tied.” (Instrument Nos. 82-3 at 43-44; 82-35 at 4). Pratt was on his
stomach at this time, and according to Deputy Medina, was held by deputies in that position for
two or three minutes until Channelview Emergency Medical Services (“EMS”) arrived on the
scene. (Instrument No. 74-3 at 5).
 EMS arrived on the scene at roughly 8:26 pm to treat Pratt. (Instrument Nos. 74-2 at 4;
82-35 at 3). Deputies Medina and Goldstein testified that Pratt was still talking when EMS
arrived. (Instrument Nos. 74-3 at 4; 74-4 at 5). One of the EMS paramedics, Billy Slagle
(“Slagle”), reported that, upon their arrival, Pratt was “hog-tied” and face down. (Instrument No.
82-35 at 3). According to Slagle, hog-tied meant that his hands and feet were both handcuffed
and then attached to each other. (Instrument No. 82-35 at 3). Slagle also testified that, upon
EMS’s arrival, Pratt was not talking, and in fact was not breathing and had no pulse. (Instrument
No. 82-35 at 4). The deputies, however, reported that it was not until EMS had removed the final
taser probe that Pratt became non-responsive, and EMS had to begin CPR. (Instrument Nos. 74-2
at 4; 74-3 at 5). Deputy Goerlitz even testified that he was the first to notice that Pratt had
appeared to stop breathing, and so had informed EMS to check his vitals again.","On Wednesday, May 12, 2010 at approximately 2100 hours, deputies responding to a minor accident

Witness: Constable told calm Amron who was just sitting outside restaurant, if you try to do anything I will not hesitate to knock the fuck out of you.

Witnesses say they saw constables place boots on Amron's head. In court deposition, Constable says he placed his feet on either side of head because Amron was banging his head so hard he thought he'd fracture his skull. But autopsy doesn't even show any bruises. (p. 124). Other officers were using feet to push on his stomach and side and legs. BUT autopsy showed contusions on face, where boot would have been (Doc's deposition, p. 70-72; 110+). AND his cocaine levels were actually very low (p. 85)

Baylor forensic prof. testifies he died of aspirating vomit, not cocaine toxicity, caused by officer pressing w/ boot (p. 36). was malpractice on officers' part (p. 41, p. 62).","Spoke w/ attorney Brad Gilde 11/7 -- trial scheduled for 1/17 in state district court. will concentrate on constable office poor training and how deputies use their feet to subdue suspects. says there is an issue w/ the autopsy finding of cocaine toxicity. says no deputies ever disciplined -- even tho at the very least there were four cruisers there but none of the dash cams worked/were turned on to record the event.

The decedent told medics that he couldn't breathe. When medics approached him, he became combative and ran away. Harris County Constable Pct. 4 officers were dispatched to assist medics in locating and treating the decedent. 

The decedent was located by deputies and he began fighting with them as they tried to assist him to the ambulance. Medics requested that he be handcuffed in order to be treated and transported. Deputies handcuffed the decedent and he was placed on a backboard and loaded into the ambulance.

No grand jury convened

https://www.news-journal.com/news/2015/may/21/gregg/

Drugs were involved, but not in the typical way - he was detoxing from his prescribed psych meds and got bad medical care.","Madewell was arrested on 3-12-13 on a bond forfeiture warrant for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

During the booking process, Madewell was asked if he had any current medical problems. He said that he had back problems, mental problems and a bullet in his right shoulder. Madewell indicated that he was taking the following medications: Xanax, Narco, Zoloft, blood pressure medications and unknown.

Madewell's mother, Betty Madewell, brought medications, Sertraline (100 mg) and Atenolol (25 mg) for her son on the day of his arrest.

On March 17th, Madewell had a violent psychotic episode and attempted to physically attack a nurse and jailer. He was uncooperative and combative even with restraints on. At times he would ramble incoherently. Madewell was asked if he was allergic to Haldol. He stated that he wasn't allergic, it's just too strong for him. Madewell was given 5 mg of Haldol per protocol. He was then transferred to a suicide watch cell for his safety.

Madewell showed no signs of allergy to Haldol.

On March 17th, Mrs. Madewell notified jail staff that her son was allergic to Haldol, Seroquil, Ultram and Flexaril. On March 18th, Madewell refused to take his medications and said that he doesn't have any shoes or clothes, so he's not taking any pills until he takes a shower with deodorant. At about 12:40 am on March 21st, the jail lieutenant received notification from a jailer that Madewell had defecated on himself and he was climbing on a table in his cell and jumping or falling off of it. A decision was made to transfer Madewell to a different cell (with a lower table) for his safety. Madewell was acting incoherent and fought five jail personnel who were moving him to a cell approximately thirty feet away. In an attempt to stop the combative behavior, Madewell was drive stun tased three times to the buttocks to gain compliance. 

At about 1:10 am on March 21st, the jail lieutenant was informed that Madewell was acting incoherent and was climbing on items in the cell and banging his head on the shower walls. A decision was made to apply a body wrap for his safety. Five jail personnel entered the cell and Madewell fought as the jailers placed him in the body wrap. He was tased again three or four times to the hip or buttocks to gain compliance. Haldol was available, but not given at this time because of the allergy concern. The jailers noted that his body temperature seemed to be very high during the incident. Once in the wrap devise, Madewell grunted and stopped fighting.

Madewell then went limp and fell over, hitting his head on the cell floor. He was placed back in a seated position. His eyes were open but he wasn't blinking. He was checked for a pulse on the neck and was found to have a heartbeat but the didn't appear to be breathing. EMS was contacted and Madewell was transported to Good Shepherd Medical Center in Longview.

Madewell never gained consciousness and he was pronounced dead at 2:09 am by Justice of the Peace, B.H. Jameson.",ab,d,"9,2,3,5",,,

After a brief pursuit the suspect wrecked his car at 1053 East Ave. A in Hamlin and officers attempted to arrest suspect for possible possession of controlled substance. Suspect resisted and was tased and pepper sprayed. Suspect taken into custody and handcuffed and leg chains were put on suspect to stop any further attempt to escape. Emergency personnel checked out suspect and removed taser probes and washed pepper spray from suspect's face and eyes and determined suspect needed no medical treatment.

Suspect had his Miranda read to him at this point and was taken to the Hamlin Police department to have his rights explained by a judge before being transported back to Fisher County. Suspect asked for a drink of water which was given to him. He indicated at this point he had a drug problem and wanted some help. He was asked numerous times if he had ingested any crack cocaine and he stated no. He was searched and nothing found on his person. A quanity of crack cocaine was found in the vehicle he was driving, both in the console and in the drivers seat. Judge Marlon Smith arrived to magistrate the suspect and during the signing of the forms the suspect begin to convulse. 

Officer Mize contacted an ambulance which was right outside the police department and the suspect was transported immediately to the Hamlin hospital. After a couple of hours the suspect was stable. The suspect's stomach had been pumped at the hospital and Officer Clark took custody of those contents. When the suspect was convulsing and throwing up there were what appeared to be crack
rocks in the liquid that the suspect was throwing up.

The suspect was flown from Hamlin hospital to Lubbock Covenant Hospital where he died at approximately 2:33 A.M. The Fisher County Sheriff's Office was notified about 3:00 A.M. It was requested that an autopsy be preformed.",js,ip,2,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/d3ad867c3b664a13aa57ab459ee20db1.jpg,"65,17,440,461"

Fannin County DA

 Phone: 903-583-7448
 E-Mail: reglaser@fanninco.net Sent on 2/1/17","On 03-14-2011, two Fannin County Sheriff's Office Deputies were dispatched to a disturbance in progress at 1441 N. State Highway 121, Bonham, Texas. As the Deputies were en-route to the above listed address, they observed a white male walking in the middle of the north bound lane of traffic of State Highway 121. The subject matched the description of the person causing said disturbance. The Deputies made contact with the subject, who was later identified as Micah Theron SHEPARD. 

SHEPARD was described as having blood on his face, arms and shirt. SHEPARD was waving his arms around and was frantically walking around. SHEPARD'S speech was slurred and was talking in a fast manner, making it difficult for the Deputies to understand what he was saying. SHEPARD did state he had been in a motor vehicle crash earlier, that his girlfriend was with him but she had walked away. 

SHEPARD could only identify himself to the officers as ""SHEPARD"". The Deputies elected to detain SHEPARD in an effort to gain further information on the disturbance, the vehicle crash and to attend to SHEPARD'S injuries. The Deputies handcuffed SHEPARD behind his back for officer safety. As the Deputies were in the process of placing SHEPARD in the backseat of a marked patrol car, SHEPARD began to resist, causing the Deputies to fall to the pavement along with SHEPARD. 

SHEPARD ended up on top of one of the Deputies (W. WALKER). The second Deputy (D. SPEED) was near SHEPARD'S upper torso but was not on top of SHEPARD. SHEPARD began kicking
Deputy WALKER who was underneath SHEPARD. Deputy WALKER, in an attempt to stop the attack, began hitting, with a flashlight, SHEPARD in the left calf area of SHEPARD'S leg while giving verbal commands to SHEPARD to stop kicking. When SHEPARD complied with these demands, Deputy WALKER ceased hitting SHEPARD'S leg. Deputy SPEED re-positioned himself over SHEPARD'S lower torso area and grabbed SHEPARD'S legs in an attempt to gain control of and stop SHEPARD from kicking Deputy WALKER. 

Deputy SPEED rolled SHEPARD onto his right side. SHEPARD was now calm and not combative; however, quickly after rolling SHEPARD onto his side, Deputy SPEED noted SHEPARD was not breathing. Deputy WALKER checked for a pulse and believed he found a pulse; however, it was shallow. Paramedics were immediately called to the scene by the Deputies. Upon arrival to the scene, the paramedics requested the handcuffs to be removed and immediately began CPR. 

Texas Ranger Brad OLIVER subsequently obtained the paramedics report from the Bonham Fire Department, which indicated SHEPARD was lying supine on the pavement when
they arrived. The report, along with obtained emergency room reports from Red River Regional Hospital, indicated CPR was in progress when the paramedics arrived at the hospital with SHEPARD. SHEPARD was unresponsive to all medical treatments and was subsequently pronounced dead my hospital staff. Ranger OLIVER attended the autopsy of SHEPARD at the Collin County Medical Examiner's Office in McKinney, Texas. Ranger OLIVER observed injuries to SHEPARD which were consistent with being involved in a motor vehicle crash, which possibly resulted in SHEPARD being ejected from the vehicle. 

The hyoid bone was examined and was noted to be intact; along with no petechia found in the eyes; which corroborates Deputies WALKER'S and SPEED'S statements that the only use of force used against SHEPARD was hitting him in the lower leg with a flash light to gain compliance. Ranger OLIVER interviewed family members of SHEPARD who indicated he was addicted to crack cocaine and methamphetamine, and was believed to have been abusing the above listed narcotics for several days prior to 03-14-2011. It will be several weeks before toxicology results are available.",ab,wd,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/beb7df960d0e40bfaabb4ca1d5bc7291.jpg,"30,21,408,469"

Interview w/ family attorney Scott Palmer (11/10): no lawsuit filed yet, but anticipates one. Officers were no-billed in June. Says private pathologist hired by the family added ""mechanical asphyxiation"" to causes of death"" -- ""There was a bruise on his neck"" from officer kneeling on him. 
""Why don't they approach these situations with a little more delicacy? You're supposed to treat these people differently. You don't want someone lying dead in your lobby. Police are supposed to be trained to handle this.""
""When an autopsy says 'excited delirium' those are two words civil rights lawyers don't like to hear, because it basically gives police a pass for their behavior. Are they really saying he was moving, he was conscious, he was breathing -- and he was just going to drop dead? The added element is unnecessary police conduct.""","On August 1, 2015 at approximately 12:15pm, I received a telephone call from Acting Sergeant Hutchins who told me that Detective Crear had been called at 11:05 am to the Lobby area of the Dallas County Jail located at 111 W. Commerce in Dallas, Texas in regards to an individual who had entered into the lobby area yelling something about they're trying to kill me. He requested that I respond to the jail and assist Detective Crear and that he would also be en route. 

I responded to the jail and went to the information desk in the lobby and was advised that Detective Crear was in the Supervisor's Office in the Intake Section. I then went to the Intake Section and met with Detective Crear and Lt. Sherman in the Supervisor's Office and talked with them in regards to this investigation. They told me that at approximately 10:25am, a white male had entered into the lobby area of the jail acting strangely and yelling something to the effect that ""they're trying to kill me.""

They told me that Deputy Reyes was working at the information desk and observed this white male. They told me that Deputy Reyes then came out from the information desk and approached this white male. They told me that Deputy Reyes then escorted this white male to the area in front of the information desk and instructed him to stand there for a minute. They told me that Deputy Reyes then started to enter the information desk office and the white male took off running across the lobby area yelling something to the effect that they're trying to kill him. Deputy Reyes pursued the white male across the lobby area and placed him on the floor and was attempting to handcuff him when the white male began struggling. 

They told me that two Detention Service Officers entered into the lobby area and observed Deputy Reyes struggling with an unknown white male on the floor. They told me that the two Detention Service Officers then assisted Deputy Reyes in getting this individual handcuffed. Lt. Sherman told me that he had received a telephone call from an unknown clerk telling him about the Deputy having problems with an individual in the lobby area. He told me that he and Deputy Veasley then responded to the lobby area to assist Deputy Reyes.

They told me that shortly after this the unknown white male became unresponsive and the Jail Medical Staff was notified and responded to the lobby. Lt. Sherman told me that the Jail Nurse from Intake arrive and began performing CPR on the unknown individual and requested that he call 911. Lt. Sherman told me that Paramedics with the Dallas Fire Department (Rescue 18) arrived in the Lobby area and took over medical treatment of the unknown male. Lt. Sherman told me that the Paramedics left the lobby with the unknown male at 11:05am en route to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Detective Crear told me that the white male had been identified as being Joseph Sheldon Hutcheson w/m 09-13-1966 and that he had been pronounced deceased at 11:31am by Dr. Ava Pierce at PMH.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/6179271a41504183967c392eeeb391f1.jpg,"0,58,545,705"

Then sent PIR to jeanette.brown@dallascounty.org","On November 25, 2014 at approximately 3:50am, the Balch Springs Police Department received a 9-1-1 call in regards to a disturbance in progress at 4317 Shephard Lane #7205 in Balch Springs, Texas. Officer Stewart and Officer Chamblee responded to the location and to the apartment. Once at the location they entered the apartment and observed a male sitting on the floor in the center of the living room with another individual who was standing beside the individual sitting on the floor. They observed that this individual, identified as being Eric Ricks, was attempting to calm the individual sitting on the floor. 

The individual sitting on the floor was identified as being Eric Ladale Ricks with a birth of 06-26-1984. The Officers observed Eric Ricks sitting on the floor, rocking back and forth and chanting, as he looked around the room. Eric Ricks was chanting, ""I'm fucking goood!"" over and over. 

The Officers observed that there was a mattress lying on the floor in the far corner of
the room, an entertainment center just inside of the door on the right, a broken glass table and a broken stone coffee table against the bar/wall that separated the kitchen from the living room. Due to Eric Ricks' behavior the Officers requested other Officers to the location. Other Officers arrived at the location and entered the apartment. 

Eric Ricks then stood up from the floor and moved towards the kitchen but his path was blocked by
Officer Chamblee. Eric Ricks then stood at the end of the bar looking around at the Officers but at the same time it appeared that he was looking through them. Officers then talked with the resident of the apartment, Shomon Bell, who told them that she knew Eric Ricks and had agreed to let him stay there for the night. She stated that Eric Ricks had been dropped off at her apartment by a friend about twenty minutes earlier. She stated that she just wanted Eric Ricks out of her apartment as she did not need any trouble from him. 

While Officers were inside of the apartment they observed a small clear plastic baggie lying on an ottoman in front of the entertainment center. Inside of this clear plastic baggie was a green leafy residue that smelled like marijuana. Officers also observed a tobacco pipe to the left of the television and it smelled like burnt marijuana. Ms. Bell then told Eric Ricks that he had to leave the apartment several times in front of the officers.

Eric Ricks refused to leave the apartment and told the Officers, ""get the fuck out of here!"" Eric Ricks stated this to the Officers several times. Officer Stewart then observed that Eric Ricks was not in the room he instructed him to come back into the living room. Eric Ricks then came out of bedroom, sat on the floor and leaned against the wall. Officer Stewart told Eric Ricks to calm down but he became more agitated. After being told several times to leave and Eric Ricks refusing to leave on his own, Sgt. Cracker and Officer Chamblee stepped towards him and told him to place his hands behind his back. Officer Chamblee then grabbed Eric Ricks' right forearm and Sgt. Cracker grabbed his left forearm. Eric Ricks then pulled away from the Officers pulling his right arm free. Sgt. Cracker
and Officer Chamblee then grabbed his right arm and moved it behind him.

Eric Ricks then began violently jerking his arms and kicking at the Officers. At this time, Officer Self deployed his taser to Eric Ricks and other Officers forced Eric Ricks to the floor in order to gain control of him. Once on the floor, Eric Ricks continued resisting the officers. Officer Stewart attempted to handcuff Eric Ricks as Sgt. Cracker and Officer Chamblee held him but he pulled his arms free and was able to get back onto his feet kicking Officer Stewart several times while doing this. Sgt. Cracker and Officer Chamblee then forced Eric Ricks against the wall near the front door. Officer Stewart then deployed his Taser on Eric Ricks. Officers then were able to place Eric Ricks face down on the floor during the Taser cycle. 

When the Taser cycle ended, Eric Ricks became more violent in his resistance, breaking a Taser wire or removing one of the Taser probes. Officer Stewart then dry stunned Eric Ricks with his Taser to gain pain compliance but it was not effective. The struggle moved to the wall area between the entertainment center and the door. 

Officer Chamblee gave his Taser to Officer Stewart but was unable to stun Eric Ricks without striking one of the Officers. Officer Stewart then observed that the entertainment center was about to fall on him. Officer Stewart stopped the entertainment center from falling as Sgt. Cracker, Officer Chamblee and Officer Self pinned Eric Ricks in the corner formed by the entertainment center, floor and the wall. Officer Stewart grabbed Eric Ricks' shirt collar and pulled him forward face down onto the floor. Eric Ricks place his hands out in front of him as he was going forward to the floor. 

Officer Stewart then placed his left knee on Eric Ricks' right arm just above the elbow to prevent him from moving it and also grabbed his right wrist, which had a handcuff on it. Sgt. Cracker had placed his right knee on Eric Ricks' left shoulder as he grabbed his left wrist, which also had a handcuff on it. The Officers then were able to link the handcuffs together and kept his arms pinned down. Officers Self and Officer Chamblee restrained Eric Ricks' legs. These Officers held this position until other Officers arrived at the location. During the struggle with the Officers Eric Ricks grabbed a portable radio from one of the Officers belts and had also bitten Officer Chamblee on the left ring finger. 

Officers then notified the Dispatcher and requested that Paramedics respond to the location. PSO Cabrerra responded to the location with a set of leg irons and these were placed on Eric
Ricks' ankles. Other Officers arrived at the location and Eric Ricks was then removed from the apartment. Paramedics arrived at the location and examined Eric Ricks. Sgt. Cracker then transported Eric Ricks to the Jail and Officer Self followed him to the Jail. When Sgt. Cracker opened the rear door of his Police vehicle he observed Eric Ricks seat belted with his head forward. Sgt. Cracker removed the seat belt and instructed Eric Ricks to get out but he did not respond. Sgt. Cracker and Officer Self then moved Eric Ricks' legs out of the Police vehicle and each grabbed an arm. 

As the Officers got him out of the Police vehicle his legs collapsed. The Officers carried him inside of the Jail and lay him on the floor. Officer Stewart observed that Eric Ricks was not breathing and checked and found that he had no pulse. Sgt. Cracker then removed the handcuffs and
rolled him over on his back. At this time Officer Stewart began performing CPR on Eric Ricks. Paramedics were again notified and responded to the Jail. Upon their arrival they took over lifesaving measures and then transported Eric Ricks to Dallas Regional Medical Center. 

Once arriving at the Hospital, Eric Ricks, was pronounced deceased at 6:20am by Dr. Madeline Aponte. On November 26, 2014, Detective Phelps with the Dallas Sheriff's Office, Investigator Byrd and Investigator Morgan attended the autopsy of Eric Ricks. This autopsy was conducted by Dr. Tracy Dyer.

Lawsuit: https://casetext.com/case/ramos-v-lucio-2 
Plaintiffs allege that the officers used excessive force in restraining Ramos, including using a hog-tie restraint that they should have known was excessive given that Ramos was suffering from a cocaine-induced psychosis.
Plaintiffs allege both state and federal claims, including that the County's Sheriff's department (""Department"") had a policy against use of a hog-tie restraint by individual officers, that the department knew or should have known that deputies were violating such policy, and that the Department's personnel were not adequately trained against the use of the hog-tie restraint.
Defendants dispute that Ramos was placed in a hog-tie restraint by the deputies. 

Furthermore, there is no evidence that the officers were ever on notice that hog-tying posed a serious danger of substantial bodily harm or death. Dkt. No. 51, at 25-26. While the Fifth Circuit noted in Gutierrez that ""San Diego mailed copies of the San Diego Study to police departments around the nation . . . in 1992,"" there is no evidence in this case that the Cameron County Sheriffs Department received a copy nor that the individual officers would have received that information sixteen years later.

Injured by self; accident","On 1/27/2006 Deputy Robert Oyervidez was dispatched to the above mentioned location in reference to a domestic disturbance in progress involving an intoxicated male subject possibly high on some type of narcotics. Deputy Juan Cortez was also en-route, and he was the first unit on scene along with Precinct 6 Deputy Constable Sgt. Perez, upon his arrival he was waved down by a Hispanic female subject who advised Deputy Cortez that the subject was inside the house.

Deputy Juan Cortez III while getting close to one of the front doors, he mentions on his report that he could hear a male subject who was later identified as Jose Ramos yelling vulgar language towards his wife Mrs. Rosa Ramos. Upon Deputy Cortez making contact with Mr. Ramos he notices that he was acting very strange, hallucinating like more people were inside the room, trying to fight him, reporting deputy told Mr. Ramos on several occasions to calm down and relax, but instead Mr. Ramos pushed him away, and began to punch him on his shoulder and face area. They struggle in the kitchen area, and outside the house until Deputy Constable from Precinct 6 - Sgt. Perez arrived and helped Deputy Cortez in the arrest of Mr. Ramos, then after several minutes they were able to subdue Mr. Ramos also with the assistance of Deputy Garcia, and Deputy Oyervidez, even with handcuff and iron shackles Mr. Ramos was still acting in a combative manner, also while restraining Mr. Ramos it was noticed that he was bleeding from his head area, and he was also complaining that he couldn't breathe. EMS was called out to the scene and Mr. Ramos was transported to Valley Baptist Medical Center located in Harlingen, TX, where moments later Mr. Ramos died.

I was called out and upon my arrival EMS was still on the scene working on Mr. Ramos I was briefed on the situation by Lt. Rodriguez who was at the scene, and I right away started taking pictures of the scene. I was advised that Mrs. Ramos was at the scene along with her mother Mrs. Maria Elena Ramos. After taking pictures of the scene I went ahead and transported both subjects to the Olmito Sheriff Department Criminal Investigation division where at location Mrs. Ramos wife of Jose Ramos provided a worn statements of the events that occurred, also Mrs. Maria Elena Ramos provided a statement of what she saw and heard. 

That same Lt. Carlos Garza, from the Olmito Sheriff office criminal investigation division, and Lt. Domingo Diaz from that Harlingen Sheriff office substation, assisted in the investigation by providing pictures of the autopsy. Also pictures of Deputy Cortez III injures were taken which were possibly broken fingers, swollen shoulder. At this point this investigation, is pending the results from the autopsy, also at location and inside Mr. Ramos vehicle which was a red Geo Tracker displaying Texas license plates (redacted) it was found in the center counsel and on the front passenger and driver floor green leafy substance and white powdery substance residue, all this were taken and as evidence and placed in the evidence locker for safekeeping.",js,d,"1,5",,custody_deaths/images/deaths/53c0aee5feaf4902be727efd4bc8102f.jpg,"34,15,434,489"

Bettyjean said that the last time she called 911 was to get police to come and save BANKS from the police that were tasing him.","On the above date at 12:50am a City of Granite Shoals police officer was dispatched to 1112 Churchill Drive, Granite Shoals, Texas, regarding a welfare concern call. A Burnet County Sheriff's unit was dispatched to assist. Approximately two minutes after the call was received both units arrived at that location. A City of Granite Shoals Fire Department unit also responded due to a report of some type of fire near the residence at this address.

As a result of the investigation conducted by units responding to this location, the occupant of this residence, Mr. Willie Banks, was placed under arrest for the offense of public intoxication. When officers attempted to restrain Banks both were assaulted by him before he was secured in handcuffs. At approximately 1:09am officers on scene advised Burnet County dispatch that additional assistance was needed and that Tasers had already been deployed. Approximately two minutes later the Burnet County deputy advises dispatch that Banks is in custody but unaffected by Tasers and that both officers have been assaulted.

During this confrontation with Banks, the arresting officers were assisted in their attempts to subdue him by the City of Granite Shoals firefighter who had also responded to the scene. At approximately 1:17am units from the Llano County Sheriffs Office and the City of Marble Falls Police Department arrive on scene and assist in placing the handcuffed and leg shackled Banks into a patrol unit. 

At approximately 1:28am the Burnet County deputy goes enroute to the jail and requests that the jail staff be prepared for the combative Banks. The deputy completes the nearly twenty-mile trip to the jail arriving in the sally port at approximately 1:47am. Banks is found unresponsive when he is removed from the back seat of the patrol car. 

Medical assistance is requested from a Burnet E.M.S. unit that was already at that location. At approximately 2:23am Burnet E.M.S. departs the jail and transports Banks to Seton Highland Lakes E.R. arriving there at 2:27am. At approximately 2:43am Banks is pronounced deceased by the attending physician, Dr. Nathaniel Stephens. Justice of the Peace Lisa Whitehead is called to the scene and orders an inquest into the death of Banks and Burnet County Sheriff W.T.

***What were results of Texas Ranger investigation?","from autopsy report:
Manner of death: Alcohol/drug intoxication
Death reason: don't know","On October 13, 2014 at approximately 2:56 am., Atascosa County Deputy Daniel Kaufman was on patrol traveling down Adams Street in Pleasanton, TX, and attempted to stop a truck that failed to signal an appropriate distance before turning. The vehicle evaded from Deputy Kaufman and after a short pursuit that went down two different streets the vehicle made a turn into a residence at 219 Hollingsworth Road and pulled under a carport/overhand and stopped.

Deputy Kaufman pulled up the driveway. At this time the driver, later identified as Macario Garcia, DOB 04/16/60, was already out of the vehicle and walking toward the rear of his vehicle. Deputy Kaufman observed Macario Garcia grabbing for something under his waist area. Deputy Kaufman was not sure if Macario Garcia had a weapon or if he was attempting to hide something. Deputy Kaufman was in fear that Macario Garcia was going to attempt to use a weapon on him. Deputy Kaufman was not able to finish his radio traffic to dispatch because he was in a hurry to exit his vehicle. Deputy Kaufman pulled his pistol but did not point it at Macario Garcia. Macario Garcia was taller and outweighed Deputy Kaufman by over 100 pounds. Macario Garcia then lifted his hands out of his waist area and Deputy Kaufman re-holstered his pistol.

 When Deputy Kaufman got close to Macario Garcia, he started walking towards the door of the trailer house. Deputy Kaufman yelled at Macario Garcia to come to him. Deputy Kaufman asked Macario Garcia why he didn't stop and told him to come with the deputy. Macario Garcia immediately became irate and wouldn't listen to Deputy Kaufman's instructions or questions. Because of Deputy Kaufman's experience and training, it appeared that Macario Garcia was intoxicated or may have ingested an unknown substance. Macario Garcia's movements were slow and he was swaying back and forth. 

Deputy Kaufman attempted to grab Macario Garcia by his arm and take him to the front of his vehicle so he could complete an arrest on Garcia for evading arrest. When Deputy Kaufman grabbed Macario Garcia, he started to push and pull with his body attempting to get the Deputy away from him. Deputy Kaufman pushed Macario Garcia against the vehicle then he pushed himself off the vehicle and attempted to turn around on Deputy Kaufman. Deputy Kaufman continued to tell Macario Garcia to turn around. 

Macario Garcia swung with his left arm at Deputy Kaufman's head. The Deputy was about to move back while still holding onto his right upper arm. Deputy Kaufman let go of Macario Garcia's arm and pulled back, pulling out his department issued Taser. Macario Garcia then got into a combative stance with his hands in a fist then Macario Garcia faced Deputy Kaufman and made a motion that he was going to lunge at the Deputy. 

Deputy Kaufman deployed his Taser on Macario Garcia with a set of probes on the chest and stomach of his body. When the probes hit Macario Garcia they looked like they were stuck on his shirt and did not properly deploy. Deputy Kaufman did not get complete neuromuscular incapacitation on Macario Garcia when the Taser deployed. Macario Garcia was still feeling some of the effects of the Taser, but not the full effects. Macario Garcia fell to his knees to the rear of the vehicle. Deputy Kaufman pressed the side trigger for another deployment for a second time for approximately 2 seconds when Macario Garcia failed to comply with the Deputy's instructions and attempted to get back up. While this was going on Macario Garcia continued to yell and be combative towards Deputy Kaufman by swinging his arms.

Deputy Kaufman continued to tell Macario Garcia to get to the ground but he wouldn't. While Deputy Kaufman was attempting to gain control of Macario Garcia, Deputy Kaufman yelled at Macario Garcia to get on his stomach and spread his arms and legs and re-holstered his Taser. Deputy Kaufman helped Macario Garcia up to his feet. Macario Garcia walked to Deputy Kaufman's patrol vehicle under his own power. About midway to the front of the Deputy's vehicle Macario Garcia started to push the Deputy to the side, attempting to knock him off balance and push him into a gate. 

While Deputy Kaufman was searching Macario Garcia for weapons the Deputy noticed that Garcia had urinated on himself. Deputy Kaufman pulled the Taser probes from Garcia's shirt. The probes were not attached to the body, they were only attached to the shirt. While Deputy Kaufman was searching Macario Garcia he was coherent and alert. While the Deputy was interviewing Macario Garcia he started shaking and his legs gave out before he could answer.

Macario Garcia started to make snoring noises. Deputy Kaufman immediately radioed dispatch and requested EMS. Macario Garcia started breathing normally and moved his head up and it seemed like he was coming out of it. After contacting dispatch again, Macario Garcia started shaking again and he took a deep breath and then stopped. Deputy Kaufman could only feel him breathing softly and his pulse was weak. Deputy Kaufman attempted to sit up Macario Garcia to help with his breathing. EMS arrived on scene. We placed Macario Garcia on his side again. EMS immediately started to work on Macario Garcia. Garcia was transported by EMS to the hospital where he died.",js,ip,"6,2",,custody_deaths/images/deaths/7d7432a581fa45d397d5ae2cd790b10b.jpg,"8,33,540,665"

Manner: Alcohol/drug intoxication

Death reason: Medical condition only",,"On 5/28/06 at around 01:51 am, I Deputy M. Huffman, 818, while at the Aransas County Jail Booking an intoxicated subject, overheard communications dispatch county units to 401 S. Kossuth in reference to a male subject that was trying to enter the home located at 401 S. Kossuth. 

Upon Arrival at around 01:53 hrs. I observed 3 individuals standing on the front porch of the home. A female at the location told me the subject was on her front porch, and that he had twice entered the house stating someone was trying to kill him. I walked up to the porch where I observed the male subject on his hands and knees. The subject was screaming and eating on a green houseplant on the porch. In the suspect's hands was a pieces of blue plastic wrap from the plant container.

The suspect's left hand was tucked under the lower part of his abdomen and I could not determine if the subject was holding anything. I approached the subject cautiously and took his right wrist, and placed one handcuff on, I attempted to secure the subject's left arm behind his back.

At this time the subject began to resist. I used a soft hand technique to place the subject to the ground on his stomach. The subject still had his left hand under his chest. I attempted to place the subject's left hand behind his back. The subject again resisted my efforts to restrain him. I was able to finally pull the subjects hand from underneath his body and as I was attempting to cuff his left hand, he began to resist again. While resisting the subject told me that he was going to fight. I called for a city unit to assist at that time. 

I was finally able to get the second handcuff on the subject's left wrist as Deputy Sgt. R. Crisp 805 was arriving on scene. Rockport City P.D. Officer S. McDonald arrived to assist myself and Sgt. Crisp attempted several times to get the subject to his feet. The subject was very non-compliant and would not help us to get him on his feet. Sgt. Crisp and I lifted the subject off of the porch by his upper biceps, and began to escort him to a patrol unit.

Once off of the porch, the subject began to resist again, at that point I administered a shot of Oleo Capsicum Resin for approx. 2 seconds onto the subjects upper forehead area. Subject continued to resist attempts to place him inside of patrol unit #7. Rockport P.D. Officer Drew and extended his ASP Baton and told the subject to stop resisting or he would strike his legs. The subject stopped trying to resist for a brief time, but again resisted as he was placed into the rear of unit #7. The subject was placed in the rear of patrol unit #7 and transported to Aransas County Detention Center.

I remained at the scene to gather information from the victims. The victims are identified as 1) Marta H. Garcia W/F D0B: (redacted) 790-4110. 2) Jeremy Hernandez W/M DOB: (redacted)790-4110. 3) Andrew Callejas W/M DOB: (redacted) SS# (redacted). Mrs. Garcia told me that she did not know the subject and after the second time he entered her home she used her body as a barricade as the subject was trying to make entry into the home for the third time. Mr. Callejas and Mr. Hernandez forced the subject off of the front porch 3 times before my arrival. The subject appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance or he appeared to be intoxicated. The subject was combative, and yelling. Subject was moaning loud and making statements that could not be understood.

I was contacted by Sgt. Crisp on my handheld radio, and told that he needed me at the Detention Center right away. I left the scene en route to the Detention Center when I overheard the Jail call for EMS and that CPR was in progress. When I arrived at the jail, I observed the subject lying on his back in hold cell A-9 and CPR was being administered by Sgt. Bradley, the shift supervisor. EMS arrived a short time later, performed CPR, then transported the subject to North Bay Hospital. Chief McLester, the on-call Investigator, Jail Capt. Kutach were notified.

Called again on 2/22","At 0328 hrs on 08/05/06 a citizen of Witchia Falls called 911. The citizen reported that a Hispanic male was at the intersection of 13th & Austin yelling in the street. He then said that the male was not wearing a shirt and he was banging on the door at a two-story house across the street from the Plantation Apartments (1201 Austin).

The City of Wichita Falls communications center then received two phone calls from residents of the Plantation Apartments. They reported that a male was in the pool area of the apartments yelling and shadow boxing. He had thrown furniture around and he had knocked over a grill. The male was wearing boxers. His wallet, pants, and socks were seen in and around the pool. Both callers said that the male did not live at the apartment complex.

Wichita Falls Police Officers Steve Ginger and Glenn Keith were dispatched and they responded to the call at the Plantation Apartments. They encountered the male at the pool. Officer Ginger told the male to get out of the pool and he did. Officer Ginger could tell that the male was intoxicated and he started to place the male under arrest for public intoxication. Officer Ginger told the male to put his hands behind his back. The male was pulling away from Officer Ginger. 

Officer Ginger said that the male was not actively resisting but he wasn't complying with his commands. Officer Ginger told Officer Keith that he was going to take the male to the
ground. They got on either side of the male and guided him down to the concrete. He was then handcuffed.

The two officers led the male to Officer Gingers patrol unit (#5891). Officer Ginger said that the male had a hard time walking on his own. The male was placed in the back seat of Officer Ginger's patrol unit. The male made a motion like he was going to kick out the window to the back door but he didn't. Officer Ginger then transported the male to the Wichita County jail (0348 hrs.) He told the dispatcher to notify the jail that the male was combative.

Officer Keith retrieved the clothing that the male had left at the pool. He took the clothing to the jail and gave it to Officer Ginger.

Officer Ginger arrived at the Wichita County Jail (0351 hrs) and he was met by three Wichita County Jailers. The jailers took the male out of the car and into the book in area. Officer Ginger said that he had not identified the male at this time. He stood by and listened as the jailers asked the male questions. The male gave the jailers his address, phone number, social security number, and place of employment. The male was identified as Jose DeJesus Ramirez. 

Ramirez became noncompliant with the jailers. The jailers took Ramirez to a single
isolation cell. He was placed on a small wooden bench in the cell, on his stomach, still handcuffed. Three jailers were holding Ramirez down until another jailer could bring the restraint chair into the cell. Wichita Falls Police Officer Tye Davis looked into the cell and noticed that the jailer holding Ramirez's legs was having problems holding his legs still. Officer Davis showed the jailer how to control Ramirez's legs by crossing Ramirez's legs and securing them in place with his (Davis) body weight. 

The jailer took over and Officer Davis left the jail. Ramirez was in the custody of the Wichita County Sheriffs Department at the point he arrived at the jail and the jailers took physical control of him. Ramirez was taken into the jail by Wichita County Jailers, he was questioned by jailers, and he was escorted to a holding cell by jailers. The only physical contact Wichita Falls Police Officers had with Ramirez was by Officer Tye Davis when he briefly assisted a jailer in securing Ramirez's legs. Ramirez was conscious and still actively resisting at that time. 

At some point thereafter, Ramirez collapsed prior to being placed in the restraint chair. The jail supervisor went to the control room to call for an ambulance. Wichita Falls Police Officer Ralph Piper was inside the control room. He called dispatch on his portable radio and requested that an ambulance be sent to the jail (0411 hrs).

AMR (American Medical Response) and Wichita Falls Fire Dept. First Responder (Engine 1-Shift C)
responded to the jail. AMR transported Ramirez to United Regional Health Care Systems 11th Street Campus. AMR arrived at the hospital 0434 hrs and Ramirez was admitted.

Investigators from the Wichita Falls Police Departments Crimes Against Persons Unit were called out to conduct a criminal investigation. Several officers were interviewed. Both Officers Steve Ginger and Glenn Keith denied using any force other than hands-on force against Ramirez. Officer Tye Davis denied using any force against Ramirez other than showing the jailer how to better secure Ramirez's legs. Two witnesses at the Plantation Apartments (Charles Dobson & Connie Oakley) denied seeing officers use any force other than hands-on force when they confronted Ramirez. Charles Dobson cleaned the pool area after Ramirez was taken to jail. He denied seeing any blood on the concrete in the pool area. 

Officer Steve Ginger's patrol unit (#5891) was checked and photographed. No blood was seen in the back seat area where Ramirez was sitting. Investigators attempted to interview Wichita County Jailers but they declined to be interviewed.

08/06/06 URHCS Dr. Leo Mercer pronounced Ramirez 0509 hrs. Wichita County Sheriffs Department Captain Grady Smith, who is also a field investigator for the Wichita County Medical Examiners Office, ordered an autopsy. Jose Ramirez was transported to the Tarrant County Medical Examiners Office in Fort Worth by the Wichita Falls Morticians and Embalming Service. Dr. Nizam Peerwani performed the autopsy on 08/07/06. Dr. Peerwani completed a preliminary autopsy report. He listed the cause of death as Pending Toxicology.

Several callers reported a vehicle had struck a telephone pole and there was not anyone in or around the vehicle.

A third call was received that indicated a large black male was walking around in the street, approximately a block away from the accident. The dispatcher was also told this person appeared to be intoxicated. When the first officer arrived she saw the black male walking in and out of traffic. She yelled at him and he began to charge at her, waving his arms up above his body.

Due to his very large size and erratic behavior, she point her handgun at him and told him to get out of the street and onto the sidewalk. He continued to run at her and she maintained a distance, until he finally ran back across the street and crouched down behind two parked cars. When the backup officer arrived, both officers began yelling commands for the man (later identified as Rodney E. Green) to show his hands and comply with their requests to roll over face down. 

As the officers attempted to secure him, Mr. Green began resisting them. Both officers encountered a person who they described as having super-human strength, and was hearing and seeing things that were not there. One officer was finally able to place a handcuff on one wrist, but Mr. Green pulled away exposing an open cuff that was a potential weapon. Mr. Green was tased by each officer total of two times, five-second cycles. Each tasing occurred with the officers attempting to take control of Mr. Green, after each single tasing. 

Additional back-up officers arrived and assisted in securing Mr. Green with three sets of handcuffs interlocking both wrists, due to his physical size. A nylon leg/ankle hobble was used to secure his feet due to his kicking, although he broke out of that device on two occasions. Once he was secured Green's head to calm him and continue speaking to him. Officers had already summoned an ambulance due to policy when someone was tased. The officer who was speaking to Mr. Green noticed that he had become unresponsive, although he was breathing.

They immediately placed him on his back and one officer began CPR until paramedics arrived on scene. The paramedics began life saving procedures for several minutes at the scene, and they transported him to a local hospital. Mr. Rodney Green arrived at the ER at 7:27pm and was pronounced dead at 10:24pm. The attending doctor told officers at the hospital that Mr. Green also tested positive for cocaine and marijuana; and was believed to have been experiencing a medical event prior to any contact with the police, due to information from a brain scan. Mr. Green's body was sent to the Dallas County M.E.s office for autopsy.",tp,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/9cccf431e4934691baf13dbdc028ad1c.jpg,"48,85,585,723"

When the officers arrived they spoke with the complainant and Mr. Williams, and the decision was made to issue a written warning to him for Criminal Trespass. During the process of completing the citation the officers learned from a records check that an active arrest warrant existed on Mr. Williams for the offense of Resisting Arrest - Surety off Bond. The two officers on scene requested assistance of a third officer prior to telling Mr. Williams that he would be arrested for the existing arrest warrant. This was done primarily because of Mr. Williams physical size (6' approximately 330 lbs.) and his increasing level of agitation. 

Once the officers told Mr. Williams that he was going to be arrested for the Resisting Arrest warrant, he walked away from the officers and grabbed onto the driver door handle of his vehicle as if was attempting to leave. Once again, the officers instructed Mr. Williams to step away from his vehicle and place his hands behind his back. Mr. Williams began to walk to the front of his vehicle and focused his attention on a piece of steel rebar that was hanging from a tree limb several feet away. As he continued toward the steel bar, the officers discharged their Tasers in the direction of Mr. Williams. He managed to pull the Taser probes from his skin and also disconnected the wire leads from one of the Tasers. The first set of Taser probes did not appear to be having any effect on Mr. Williams. 

Once Mr. Williams managed to free himself from the Taser probes, he turned and grabbed the steel bar. Officers felt he was going to use the rebar as a weapon against them. Both officers discharged their Tasers again, striking Mr. Williams in his front and back upper torso. Mr. Williams began to run away from the officers; once again attempting to disconnect the Taser probes. The officers followed him and he fell down to the ground approximately 30"" from his vehicle. The officers continued to yell instructions to him to stop resisting and remain still. Mr. Williams was lying on his back at this point. 

When the back-up officers arrived and attempted to secure Mr. Williams by placing handcuffs on him, be began resisting again. The initial officers activated their Tasers once again and Mr. Williams stopped his aggression until the officers tried to secure him. Mr. Williams began rolling on the ground and struggling with the officers and managed to disconnect one set of the Taser probes. During the struggle with Mr. Williams, one officer activated his Taser as a stun gun. 

Officers finally managed to secure Mr. Williams. Officers immediately propped Mr. Williams up in a sitting position and two officers positioned themselves behind him, so he could lean against them. Mr. Williams was handcuffed behind his back. Very shortly after getting Mr. Williams into a sitting position, officers noticed that he was having difficulty breathing and they requested an ambulance. 

Officers began talking to Mr. Williams and trying to cool him down. They also began administering first aid until the paramedics arrived. The handcuffs were taken off of Mr. Williams to allow easier access to administer emergency first aid. Mr. Williams was transported to a local hospital by ambulance. Upon arrival at the emergency room, his condition was that he was not responding to life saving techniques. Mr. Williams died in the emergency room at 4:53 pm.",tp,,"2,6",,custody_deaths/images/deaths/8df5c26e6e6340a3ba9e807c47395bae.jpg,"50,15,460,500"

A staff member of the Center was requesting that Waco Police officers assist them with a person who was behaving very erratic and exhibiting violent behavior. The staff member told the dispatcher that the suspect's wife had brought him to DePaul, and she was trying to get him admitted when his behavior suddenly changed from somewhat calm, to being very emotional and erratic. 

Prior to the beat officers arriving on-scene, security personnel from Providence Medical Center responded to assist. The two security officers are commissioned peace officers, one with the Waco Police Department and the other with the McLennan County Sheriff's Department. (Both were off-duty and working as security officers with the Medical Center). When they arrived at the DePaul Center, they encountered the suspect just inside the lobby area. The suspect had already injured himself by running into a pair of locked doors, and then getting up and running out into the parking lot eventually falling down causing an abrasion to his face and forehead.

The security personnel succeeded in getting the suspect on the ground and placed handcuffs on him. His hands were cuffed behind his back and he was placed on his right side. When Waco Police officers arrived they discovered security personnel and the suspect just inside the lobby entrance. They saw the suspect still being able to move and kick at the officers and a DePaul staff member. 

They continued to have difficulty controlling the suspect, who was now identified to them as Francisco Ray Olivarez, age 33. Waco Police officers, security officers and a DePaul staff member secured Mr. Olivarez on the ground until he could be placed on a gurney, and then loaded into an ambulance for transport to a nearby hospital emergency room. (Mr. Olivarez was to undergo a psychiatric evaluation at the emergency room and receive treatment for minor abrasions he received which resulted when he ran into a door and then fell).

A pair of leg restraints was placed around Mr. Olivarez's ankles to make it easier to control his legs, to avoid injuring himself or the personnel who were trying to help him. He was also kept on his right side while on the ground, and during transport in the ambulance. The trip from the DePaul Center to Providence Medical Center took approximately two minutes. Two Waco Police officers rode in the ambulance with the paramedic to help control Mr. Olivarez. Throughout the incident at DePaul and during the transport to the emergency room, Mr. Olivarez was combative and hostile towards everyone. 

Upon arriving at Providence Hospital, paramedics and the Waco Police officers unloaded the gurney and rolled Mr. Olivarez into the Emergency Room. When they were attempting to place him inside a treatment room, Mr. Olivarez was behaving so violently, he almost caused the gurney to fall over and collapse. Medical staff of the Emergency Center began to assist, and with their help Mr. Olivarez was moved from the ambulance gurney to a bed, inside a treatment room.

It was within minutes that it was noticed he stopped behaving violently and was apparently not breathing normally. Medical staff immediately began administering life saving techniques, but Mr. Olivarez died in the Emergency Room. 

Mr. Olivarez's body was sent to the Dallas County Medical Examiners office for a forensic autopsy, per order of J.P. William Martin, Precinct 1, Place 2, McLennan County. Additional information learned from his wife and mother, indicated that Mr. Olivarez was Bi-Polar and frequently smoked marijuana and used cocaine. It was also learned that he had been experiencing seizures for the last 6-8 months, but he refused to seek medical attention and would not take his prescribed medication for his Bi-Polar condition. 

Mr. Olivarez's wife, Abigail Houston, told Waco Police Sgt. Price, that her husband had suffered a seizure while driving his vehicle 1 week prior to the incident. Mr. Olivarez was involved in a motor vehicle accident as a result of that seizure. Mrs. Houston was also present at the DePaul Center on January 12, 2007. She told Sgt. Price that the behavior she witnessed from her husband resembled that of when he was having a seizure, and/or when he was abusing illicit narcotics.  (A controlled substance, powder cocaine, was also found inside Mr. Olivarez's wallet. The wallet was in the right rear pants pocket). 

On January 19, 2007, Sgt. Price received a preliminary report from the Dallas County Medical Examiners office, which indicated the final autopsy report is pending a complete Toxicology analysis.

reference to a disturbance. Prior to our arrival VDP Dispatch advised that the second party in the disturbance had already left the location.

OFFICER OBSERVATION/ACTIONS:
As Officer Stillwell and myself approached the door we heard movement coming from inside the apartment, we heard someone in the apartment crashing around. Officer Stillwell knocked on the front door and we both saw a white male, later identified as Frank Benavides (suspect), wearing a blue shirt and white underwear walking in front of the living room window. The window was
broken and several large shards of glass were sticking out of the window frame. There were mini blinds that were obscuring a full view of the interior of the apartment.

Frank seemed very agitated, Frank would walk up to the broken window and press up against the mini blind through the opening in the window allowing the glass to cut his leg. Frank would then walk towards the front door. I could hear noises as if he was checking to see if the door was locked.
Myself and Officer Stillwell called to Frank several times through the broken window in an attempt to make contact with him. With each attempt, Frank seemed to become more and more agitated, the sounds from inside the apartment became louder. At this time Officer Stillwell and myself backed off to allow more distance and contacted VPD Dispatch for additional units to respond.

Officers J. Sager #1489 and D. Brogger #1535 responded to the location to provide backup.
Officer Stillwell cut the mini blind down to allow a better view inside the apartment. Once doing this, Frank's injuries were more easily observed and appeared critical.

Officer Sager and myself took up a position at the rear of the location to cover the rear sliding glass door due to Frank moving toward the back of the apartment. Officer Sager and myself had only been around back less than five minutes when Officer Brogger advised us to come around front.

Now believing that we had exigent circumstances to enter the location and to stop Frank from further hurting himself and render medical treatment, we decided to go in. At this time management arrived at the location with keys. I attempted all of the keys on the key ring and none of the keys would unlock the door. Sgt. S. Eyre #1303 arrived at the location as I was trying the keys. Due to the fact we were not able to unlock the front door Sgt. Eyre breeched the front door.

Officer T. Hoggard #1401 with his Cadet J. Hobbs #1505 responded to the location for additional assistance. Sgt. Eyre, Officer Stillwell, Officer Sager and Officer Brogger were able to gain control of Frank and handcuff him.

The inside of the apartment was in complete disarray, empty beer bottles were all over the place. Blood was all over the walls, floors and furniture. I had to move a chair out of the way so that Frank could be moved outside for medical treatment. Frank continued to resist efforts to help him by trying to pull away. Frank was placed on the grass in the center court yard face down as he continued to struggle.

Officer Stillwell was on Frank's left side, Officer Sager was on Frank's right side and Sgt. Eyre was at his head, all of this was done in an attempt to maintain control of Frank so he would not injure himself any more. Medic 5 responded to the location at this time from their staging area at 100 Regency. EMT Mark Flathouse #6188 and Raul Liendo #4599 were the responding medics.

Due to Frank still not cooperating, Officer Hoggard placed leg restraints on Frank. As Medics treated Frank, I continued to watch his face to make sure he was not in distress. The EMTs were able to bandage up the two lacerations on Frank's right leg. At this time EMT Liendo went back to the ambulance to retrieve the stretcher. Upon Liendo's return, Sgt. Eye and Officer Sager assisted the EMTs place Frank on the stretcher. The EMTs continued treatment of Frank when Sager observed that Frank was not breathing. The EMTs moved him to the ambulance and started CPR. I climbed in the back of the ambulance to assist with CPR. I rode with EMS to the hospital.

Once at the hospital Dr. Vaughn was able to stabilize Frank and get a pulse. Dr. Vaughn advised that Frank was in critical condition and that he would be moved to ICU later this date.",js,d,,,,

A security monitoring company had observed via security camera, a white male subject lurking around a residence and asked the police to respond to the location. 

Officers arrived on scene and quickly located a white male that fit the description. As officers attempted to speak with him, the white male subject assaulted one of the officers and pushed him to the ground. The male subject then fled on foot. Due to his size (5'8"", 275 pounds) he was unable to flee quickly and the officers caught up to him, advising him he was under arrest and ordering him to place himself on the ground. He refused and became combative with the officers. Officers used pepper spray in an attempt to subdue him but the pepper spray appeared to have no effect on him.

The white male then fled again and officers again caught up with him after a short foot chase. Officers took him to the ground by tackling his legs and began to attempt to handcuff him. He struggled with officers on the ground for approximately eight (8) minutes before the officers were finally able to use two sets of cuffs to handcuff him behind his back. As per department policy, officers requested an ambulance to the scene to decontaminate the male subject from the pepper spray. 

The ambulance arrived and paramedics were speaking to the subject for a short time when the male subject stopped breathing. CPR was started immediately by officers and paramedics. The subject was transported to a hospital while CPR continued. At 2:25am, officers were advised by hospital staff that the subject had expired.",ed,,"1,6,7",,custody_deaths/images/deaths/cf708ac8f39d45e096ff51389414728a.jpg,"0,54,800,1004"

Responded, done","On Sunday, August 09, 2015, at about 4:21 a.m., Terrell Police received a call of a Concern for Welfare in 1200 block of W. Moore Ave. A male subject wearing only a blue shirt and underwear was behaving very strangely and was carrying a dog. Sergeant J. Lyons, Cpl. J. Tidwell, Off. B. Petty, Off. B. Lewis and Off. S. Palmer responded. 

Upon arrival, at 4:23 am, the police immediately recognized the subject was under the
influence of some type of drug or chemical. The subject also appeared to be ""trying to tear the little dog to bits"". Police were able to secure the dog. A Careflight ambulance was requested at 4:27 am, and responded. Fire Department first responders were dispatched as well. EMS and first responders arrived at 4:33 am.

The subject, identified as Gary James Wells (05/15/1973) told police he had just gotten promoted and had snorted 5 rails of cocaine to celebrate. At some point in his celebration, Wells took his dog and began running to West Moore Ave, from the Storage Place located at 350 British Flying School Blvd. (FM 2578), where he lived. Wells was sweating profusely and claimed he was running from people that had come into his house to kill him. Wells' feet were injured and bleeding from running with no shoes on. 

Wells stated that he ran up South State Highway 34 to Moore Avenue. It is estimated that Wells ran approximately 3.1 miles, based on Google Maps, using South State Highway 34 as the route from the Storage Place to the 1200 block of West Moore Avenue. The temperature at the time was approximately 79.

Wells agreed to allow the police to take his dog back to his residence and to check and secure it. Palmer and Lewis went to the apartment leaving Lyons, Tidwell and Petty at the scene. The dog was determined to be uninjured. Upon arrival at the apartment, Palmer and Lewis discovered the door ajar. Palmer and Lewis entered and checked the apartment for any signs that would support Wells' claim that people had forced entry into his apartment. 

Lewis observed a rolled up one dollar bill, consistent with what would be used to snort cocaine, laying on a desk. Finding no signs of forced entry or foul play, Palmer and Lewis secured the
residence, leaving the dog inside. They then returned to the 1200 block of West Moore Avenue.
While Palmer and Lewis were securing the residence, Lyons was able to talk Wells into letting the EMS
personnel evaluate his condition. Wells voluntarily got into the ambulance to be evaluated. Paramedic John Hulsey Jr. and Emergency Medical Technician Matthew Oyervides performed their initial assessment of Wells. Lyons, Tidwell and Petty remained at the scene standing outside of the ambulance. 

At 4:45 am, ambulance personnel requested assistance from police because Wells had become combative. He was pulling medical equipment loose that was required for evaluation and treatment, and attempting to hit, bite, kick and spit on ambulance personnel. Lyons and Petty entered the ambulance and assisted by holding Wells down by his wrists, as Officer Tidwell held down his legs, standing in the back of the ambulance. 

Ambulance staff used a commercially manufactured soft cloth restraint to secure Wells' wrists and ankles to the stretcher. Wells continued to struggle against the soft restraints, eventually using enough force to free up the range of movement in his arms. Due to the renewed range of movement, it was necessary to secure his arms to the stretcher with police handcuffs. At 4:55 am, Lyons then used his and Petty's handcuffs to secure Wells' wrists to the stretcher rails, left wrist to left rail and right wrist to right rail, to keep him from injuring himself or others. 

At 5:04 am, after Wells was secured, EMS began to transport Wells to Presbyterian Hospital
in Kaufman for further treatment. Lyons rode in the back of the ambulance to insure safety. Petty followed in a police vehicle.

At approximately 5:08 am, while in the 1600 block of South State Highway 34, Wells suddenly stopped fighting and went completely limp. Wells began vomiting and turned blue. Hulsey directed Lyons to begin chest compressions. The ambulance immediately stopped so that both Hulsey and Oyervides could treat Wells.

Petty, who was following the ambulance, got out of his vehicle and entered the ambulance to assist. Inside Hulsey and Oyervides where working to stabilize Wells, while Lyons was doing chest compressions. Petty removed the handcuffs. Lyons and Petty then switched off doing chest compressions while Hulsey and Oyervides were doing other medical procedures.

At about 5:37 am, EMS resumed transportation of Wells. However, due to the nature of Wells condition, they diverted to Lake Point Hospital in Forney. Lyons and Petty remained in the ambulance performing chest compressions during transportation. At 5:50 am, the ambulance arrived at Lake Point Hospital and Wells was rushed into the emergency room. Lyons and Petty went to another area in the emergency room and washed up due to being exposed to Wells' bile, spit, sweat and blood during his treatment. 

When Lyons returned to the area he was advised by one of the medical staff that treated Wells that he had died. At 5:54, Derrick Dvorak MD, pronounced Wells dead. Other Lake Point staff involved in Wells treatment were, Kyle Ware RN (primary nurse), Beth Gailley RN and Donald Sutherland R/T

Justice of the Peace, Judge Ashcroft was called to the hospital. Ashcroft ordered an inquest and sent Wells to the Southwest Institute of Forensic Science in Dallas for an autopsy. The results are pending.
Forney Police Officer J. Taylor also responded to the hospital.

Terrell Police Detective D. Bridges responded and began a unattended death investigation.
No Police, EMS or Fire personnel struck or caused any injury to Wells. The only contact police had with Wells was securing him for medical treatment and performing chest compressions at the direction of EMS personnel.

It is believed that Wells expired due to drugs or chemicals that he voluntarily ingested.",ab,d,1,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/b4ab495a52174398a0201119da564a60.jpg,"0,28,585,722"

Dallas

Mr. Plohetski, 

I hope the information below is helpful in answering your questions regarding the 2005 death of Curtis Lewis:

1.	TPD officers Steven Taylor and William Bracewell were indefinitely suspended as a result of the in-custody death of Curtis Lewis. Indefinite suspension is the equivalent of termination under civil service law. On appeal, both officers’ suspensions were reduced from indefinite to 15 days by independent third-party hearing examiners.

2.	The case was investigated by Texas Ranger Jesse Ramos, per policy for any in-custody death, and presented to the Bell county grand jury. 

3.	The grand jury issued No Bills for both officers.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

(fax) 254-298-5711","Temple Police Officers were dispatched to a possible fight call on 01/09/05 at about 2350 hrs in the 600 block of S 7th St in Temple, TX. Ofc. Steve Taylor arrived and saw one b/m, later identified as Curtis Lee Lewis 10/30/48, lying face up in the street screaming and holding a cooking pot in both hands and banging it on the ground on either side of his head. 

Ofc. Taylor's car is equipped with a Mobile Video Recorder, MVR, and it recorded this incident both visual and audio. Ofc. Carlos Maldonado arrives to assist Ofc. Taylor. Ofc. Taylor realizes that this incident is not a fight call and is instead a subject having deliriums and in need of a psychological evaluation. Ofc. Meadows arrives as Ofc. Taylor removes the pot from Lewis. Lewis is not responding to commands from officers and is still screaming while lying on the street. Lewis is rolled over onto his stomach and placed in handcuffs. Lewis is still screaming and Ofc. Taylor decides to transport Lewis to Scott and White Emergency Room for a mental evaluation. 

Ofc. Maldonado then places his left knee onto the right flank of Lewis to keep him move moving around. Maldonado did this for about 23 seconds and was putting a majority of the weight on his right leg which was out to his side to support his weight. Maldonado stands up and Lewis is still heard screaming just as he was before.

Ofc. Taylor and Meadows move Lewis to the backseat of Taylor's Patrol unit which is equipped with a plastic seat and protective screen for transport. Lewis then becomes rigid and refuses to bend his legs to allow the doors to be shut. Ofc. Taylor and Ofc Bracewell decide to place Lewis in a hobble restraint to allow for transport. Lewis is placed in the hobble restraint while in the backseat of Taylor's car. Taylor has turned the camera for the MVR around so that it shows the activity in the backseat. Ofc. Taylor and Ofc. Meadows can be seen placing Lewis in the hobble restraint. Lewis is still making noise and resisting being put in the restraint by stiffening his legs. Ofc. Taylor delivers a single hammer fist to the area above the back of Lewis's right knee which causes it to bend and enables Taylor to hand his end of the hobble to Ofc. Meadows, who is at Lewis's head. Ofc. Meadows pulls on his end of the hobble and attaches it to the handcuff chain.

At this time the video shows that Lewis is not making any movements or sounds. The doors are shut to Taylor's car and he begins transport to take Lewis to Scott and White ER. Ofc. Meadows and Bracewell follow Taylor to the ER and the transport time is roughly 4 minutes. Lewis did not move or make a sound during transport. Lewis is removed from the car and placed face first onto the ground so the hobble can be removed. The hobble is removed and Lewis is then placed face first onto a stretcher to be taken into the ER. Once inside the ER it is determined that Lewis has no pulse and is not breathing. Lewis has pronounced deceased at 1249 am by JP GW Ivey of Bell County.

Lewis was taken to Southwest Institute of Forensics (SWIF) in Dallas for an autopsy on 01/10/05. Preliminary autopsy results show no signs of trauma and are pending toxicology results. Dr. Salzberger at SWIF is the attending Examiner in this case.",tp,d,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/ab79ec0207b14491a16fe4d658582d85.jpg,"0,7,460,553"

Officers made contact with Silvestre Garcia down the street where he was found naked and appeared to be under the influence of something. The officers attempted to take him into custody by placing handcuffs on him and Silvestre Garcia put up some passive resistance.

When Officers Smith # 0352 and Garcia # 1428 arrived in the area, they parked and listened for gunfire. 

While the two officers were listening for gunshots, they noticed the Complainant running down the street and screaming for help. Officers Smith and Garcia proceeded to try to contact the Complainant and assist him. The Complainant then began acting irrationally, shaking a fence and groaning. Officer Smith attempted to calm the Complainant. While Officer Smith was attempting to calm the Complainant, the Complainant turned and attacked Officer Smith. Officer Smith separated himself from the Complainant and gained distance between the two. Officer Smith then exposed the Complainant to pepper spray in an effort to get the Complainant to comply. The pepper spray had no effect on the complainant.

The Complainant was able to get the canister of pepper spray away from Officer Smith and broke the trigger mechanism, which made the pepper spray canister unusable. Officer Smith then began to wrestle with the Complainant and they both fell to the ground. 

Officer Garcia then attempted several times to use joint manipulations and open handed techniques, but they were not successful. Officer Garcia then pulled his X26 model taser and fired the weapon in a drive stun mode three times onto the side and back of the Complainant. The taser had no effect on the Complainant. Then Officer Garcia placed his taser on the ground away from the Complainant and then proceeded to use open handed techniques again and was finally able to handcuff the Complainant along with help from Officer Smith. When the Complainant was rolled over, both officers noticed that the Complainant was not responsive. Both officers called for EMS and began CPR on the Complainant. When EMS arrived, they were unable to revive the Complainant and pronounced him deceased at 0434 hours. 

Had the Complainant survived the incident, an emergency detention would have been done and the Complainant would have been taken to a hospital for psychiatric evaluation.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/e9112dc28a094c2bb2c172d592b5d83b.jpg,"17,17,406,478"

When the ambulance arrived, Robert Lerma admitted to the Paramedics that he had ingested cocaine approximately an hour before their arrival. Robert Lerma complained of chest pain and difficulty breathing but rejected the Paramedics advice and warnings about the possibility of a heart attack and death. 

Robert Lerma signed a waiver of treatment and left the ambulance on his own. While Paramedics were still on the scene, neighbors advised them that Robert Lerma was running around and was trying to break into peoples houses. 

SAPD Officers arrived and handcuffed Robert Lerma who now was extremely combative and violent. EMS heard Robert Lerma yell, Shoot me in the head. The Paramedics requested the officers place Robert Lerma under an emergency detention for his safety and that of others. The police wagon was requested and Robert Lerma was transported to University Hospital. 

Upon arrival to the hospital Robert Lerma was conscious and remained combative. Robert Lerma was removed from the police wagon by University police and security personnel and placed face down onto a stretcher.

A police officer attempted to initiate a traffic stop on the vehicle that Abernathy was driving by activating his emergency lights and siren. 

Abernathy refused to stop his vehicle and took officers on a low speed pursuit that lasted more than thirty minutes. Abernathy drove his vehicle to 10807 Deep Water Bay and parked. 

The officers who had been pursuing him attempted to take him into custody by ordering him out of the vehicle. Abernathy initially ignored the officers but did get out of his vehicle. Abernathy is a very large man, standing at 510 tall and weighing 260 pounds. 

Officers placed Abernathy on his knees and were able to get a handcuff on his right arm. When officers went to get Abernathys left arm he immediately started throwing his left arm around and resisted being handcuffed. Because of his large physical presence officers deployed a Taser. 

A Taser was used on Abernathy but it had no effect. Abernathy was able to pick himself up off of the ground by physically moving several officers off of him. A police K-9 was on the scene and the police K-9 was used and the K-9 bit Abernathy on the buttocks. Abernathy continued running and resisting being handcuffed. 

Abernathy continued running and went between several yards and houses. Abernathy eventually tripped over a bush and fell. Officers were then able to catch up with him and hold him on the ground. Officers continued to try to get Abernathys left arm behind his back and he violently resisted. A Taser was deployed again and Abernathy pulled the Taser probes out of his back. 

An officer did what is referred to as a Drive Stun with the Taser and officers were finally able to get Abernathy handcuffed. After Abernathy was handcuffed he started to calm down and after approximately three minutes he went unresponsive. EMS was already on scene. Abernathy was transported to Christus Santa Rosa Hospital at Westover Hills and he was pronounced deceased at 0436 08/04/2011. 

An autopsy was performed on Abernathy on 08/05/2011. There were no injuries caused by officers that would cause the death of Abernathy. Abernathys mother was at the scene and she stated that Abernathy was acting like he had used Crack Cocaine. 

She was basing that on her past experience with him while he was under the influence of Crack Cocaine.

The two officers continued to try and handcuff the Deceased, and he continued to kick, flail and resist the officers. The officers were becoming winded and tired and a large crowd had now gathered around the officers. The cover officer felt the deceased pulling on his gun belt and felt an urgent need to get control of the Deceased. 

That officer then struck the Deceased in the face with his left fist two or three times to try and gain compliance, but the strikes had no effect on the Deceased. Two more officers arrived and they struggled along with the first two officers to gain control of the Deceased. One officer attempted to use his night stick under the Deceaseds arm, as an armbar control, and the Deceased continued to struggle. 

The officers were finally able to handcuff the Deceased and then roll him onto his side and into a sitting position. One Officer stood behind the Deceased to support him in an upright position because the Deceased continued to try and roll back onto his side. 

One officer called EMS because the Deceaseds nose was bleeding. After a few seconds it was discovered that the Deceased was not breathing. One officer attempted to feel for a pulse. The Deceased was unhandcuffed and laid on his back.

While officers were approaching, the deceased exited his wrecked vehicle and began fleeing on foot. 

The deceased was fleeing north on the access road away from Eisenhauer Road and the crash scene. Officers were able to communicate commands over the police vehicle public address system instructing the deceased to stop. The deceased complied and stopped on the grass median located between the access road and IH-35N. 

While one officer was attempting to restrain the deceased, another officer stood as overwatch with his conducted electrical weapon (CEW) in a ready position. The CEW was deployed twice on the deceased due to his continued resistance and combativeness. After the effect of the CEW diminished, the deceased complied and the handcuffs were connected.

R. Neaves #1292 observed the man, a short distance away, and drove his marked patrol vehicle to the location where the man was running in and out of traffic. 

As R. Neaves #1292 was enroute the Complainant laid down in the roadway and began rolling. R. Neaves #1292 approached the Complainant and gave verbal commands. The Complainant did not comply with the commands and continued to roll around in the roadway. 

R. Neaves #1292 stated that the Complainant appeared intoxicated and was a danger to himself and others and handcuffed the Complainant for his safety and in order to control the Complainant. Off. A. Lopez #121 arrived and observed R. Neaves #1292 and the Complainant still in the middle of the road. The Complainant was screaming and trying to roll away. According to A. Lopez #121 the 

Complainant appeared to be on some kind of drugs because she observed the Complainant to be foaming from the mouth, screaming and acting as if someone was after him. R. Neaves #1292 and A. Lopez #121 attempted to move the Complainant but he would not comply and went limp when the officers tried to move him. The Complainant went through phases of excitedness and then he would become calm. 

A. Lopez #121 was able to get the Complainant to give her his name and date of birth;
and state he took some drugs. Sgt. A. Valdez #3031 arrived as R. Neaves #1292 and A. Lopez #121 were trying to move the Complainant. According to Sgt. A. Valdez #3031 the Complainant was a large Hispanic male and he appeared to be twisting his body in a attempt to prevent the officers from moving him. 

The officers were unsuccessful in getting the Complainant into their patrol car and the Complainant was placed behind the patrol car. The Complainant was again observed to calm down then become excited and begin thrashing around. 

On several occasions the Complainant had to be held down to prevent him from rolling back into traffic. The dispatcher was notified to request the police wagon since the officers could not get the Complainant into their vehicle due to his uncooperative behavior and his size. The Complainant was still trying to roll into traffic. The Complainant finally calmed down and the officers no longer had to physically control him but stood close. 

The dispatcher was notified to send EMS. The officers continued to observe the Complainant for fear that he would become violent again. While waiting for EMS the Complainant appeared to stop breathing and EMS was notified to step it up. The Complainant was placed in the seated position and his head was held up to open his airway and aid his breathing.

When they arrived they were directed to a location at the rear of 131 Cree. Officer Vargas and Officer Edwards found two males holding a suspect on the ground. The suspect was face down on the ground and being restrained by the two males who were later identified as homeowners in the neighborhood. 

One of the males asked for a set of handcuffs so as not to lose control of the male. Officer Vargas assessed the situation and saw that if he (Officer Vargas) tried to secure handcuffs on the suspect it would require the homeowner to move off the suspect. Officer Vargas determined the safest way to secure the suspect was to allow the homeowner to begin the handcuffing process. The homeowner placed one handcuff on the suspect and then Officer Vargas with the assistance of Officer Edwards was able to secure both of the suspect's hands behind his back. The officers reported very little resistance from the suspect at this point and reported they used no physical force beyond the minimal force needed to maneuver the suspects remaining arm behind his back. After the suspect was secure the officers attempted to communicate with him but got no response. 

They immediately maneuvered the suspect onto his back and observed his eyes rolled back into his head and foam coming from his mouth and nose. The officers requested EMS. Officer Juarez arrived at the scene at this time. Officer Juarez is a tactical medic and the suspect was un-handcuffed and CPR was immediately started.

The reporting party had been advised by a juvenile male who was in apartment 15 at the time and observed Micah Key hitting Carla Key. 

Upon arrival, two San Angelo Police officers observe Micah Key standing in the doorway of apartment 15. The officers requested Micah Key to come downstairs, but Micah Key refused and told the officers to come to him.Once upstairs, the officers asked Micah Key to step outside. Micah Key refused and made an aggressive gesture towards the officers. Due to Micah Keys large size, the officers attempted to detain Micah key and place him in handcuffs to conduct an investigation into the complaint. 

Micah Key refused to comply with instructions for handcuffing and began to actively resist. The officers had Micah Key against the wall inside the apartment, but did not have control of Micah Key. One officer announced he was going to deploy a taser, then deployed the probes into Micah Keys middle left front torso.

 Micah Key rushed the tasing officer, grabbed him in a bear hug, and pinned the officer against the wall, knocking over a television and TV stand. Upon grabbing the tasing officer, the officers finger and hand were jammed and the tasing officer could not disengage the taser trigger, causing the taser to continue to fire for approximately 24 seconds. The second officer jumped on Micah Keys back and pulled backwards, causing the tasing officer, the second officer, and Micah Key to fall to the ground.

 Micah Key continued to resist being handcuffed, and the tasing officer delivered a 5 second drive stun to the lower back of Micah Key. Both officers were able to handcuff Micah Keys right hand, and utilized an ASP baton to pry Micah Keys left arm from under his torso, and handcuff his left hand behind his back. The officers sat Micah Key up and he was still breathing, although labored. Officers immediately called for an ambulance. Micah Key became unresponsive and the officers removed the handcuffs and began CPR.

The suspect moved toward the police car, stopped, took off his shorts and underwear and was now completely nude. The suspect was ordered numerous times to place his hands behind his back but refused. 

The suspect charged the officers and a Taser was deployed which had no effect on the suspects aggressive actions. The suspect fell over a pile of trash and officers attempted to handcuff him but he continued to kick and was able to throw officers off of his back. 

He escaped officers but was wrestled to the ground by officers. The suspect continued to kick violently as he was handcuffed. Emergency medical personnel arrived and transported the suspect to the Medical Center of Southeast Texas. The suspect was pronounced dead at the hospital at 11:06 pm.",tp,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/e17ba504f360479fb8cf967578c21ca6.jpg,"0,7,460,553"

No grand jury","On September 14, 2015, officers responded to a disturbance at a local hotel located in Plano, Texas. This call originated from the hotel clerk who received multiple complaints about possibly three subjects who were yelling and fighting in a room. The initial officer arrived and when exiting the elevator on his way to the room, he heard a loud crash like an object being thrown across the room, and what sounded like several people yelling.

Additional officers arrived they knocked on the door but received no response. Based on the circumstances, the officers attempted to enter the room with a key but the door was secured from the inside. The supervising sergeant went to retrieve breaching tools while the remaining officers continued to hear yelling and objects being thrown around the room.

Officers forced their way into the room and found it to be in disarray and the subject, later determined to be Weldon Baker, was standing against the far wall sweating profusely and appeared to have vomit or urine on his clothing. Mr. Baker appeared disoriented and was mumbling and yelling unintelligently and the officers realized this was a possible overdose/excited delirium situation. Mr. Baker failed to follow the officer's commands and attempted to open the window or bang on the window as if he was trying to break the glass to jump out of the third floor room. Officers grabbed Mr. Baker and he struggled as they attempted to put handcuffs on him. He was placed on his side and was being held down as the officers waited for FD personnel to arrive. 

During this time, Mr. Baker continued to struggle and would go back and forth between periods of
lucidity and screaming erratically. The officers attempted to speak to Mr. Baker and he stated that he had been smoking ""wet"" marijuana, which is marijuana laced with PCP. He also stated that he had a history of heart attacks and had surgery but was not able to give details on the type of surgery performed.

FD personnel quickly arrived and administered medication in an effort to sedate Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker stopped struggling within a couple of minutes and officers no longer needed to hold him down. Officers removed the handcuffs from behind his back and handcuffed him in the front so he could be placed on a gurney. FD personnel took Mr. Baker downstairs and loaded him into the ambulance to transport him to the hospital. At this time, Mr. Baker suffered what appeared to be a cardiac event and FD personnel began to perform CPR.

FD transported him to the hospital where he was pronounced dead at 5:43 a.m. The Collin County Medical Examiner was contacted and autopsy results are pending.",ab,d,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/e575fd98c6954ad980596cfeeea1aa93.jpg,"23,83,551,710"

The report came out as a B/M sexually assaulting a B/F wearing a grey night shirt who would later be identified as the arrestees wife, Shakiira Lombardo (B/F DOB redacted) in a creek bed. 

The RP and later victim Robert D. Herrington (W/M DOB redacted) along with his wife, Krystal Herrington (W/F DOB redacted) and her mother, Barbara Stephens (W/F DOB redacted) all heard screams coming from behind the residence. Mr. And Mrs. Herrington went out to the back yard and saw Mr. And Mrs. Lombardo struggling and screaming in what looked like a sexual assault taking place. 

The Herringtons retreated into their residence where Mr. Herrington grabbed his handgun and went back out to confront the arrestee while Mrs. Herrington and Stephens fled out the front door and into the street. When confronted by Mr. Herrington the arrestee stated that he would kill Mr. Herrington and at that time Mr. Herrington went back inside of his house and locked the door. 

The arrestee then broke into the residence and was again confronted by Mr. Herrington with his handgun and the arrestee walked out of the front door of the Herrington residence and into the front yard with Mrs. Lombardo. Mrs. Lombardo stated to officers that the arrestee collapsed in the Herringtons front yard and then rolled into the street.

Upon arriving at the scene I observed Officer Schifelbein #1481 with the arrestee. The arrestee, Qwame Lombardo (B/M 7/26/82) was in handcuffs with his hands behind his back sitting on the pavement. The arrestee was breathing normally, moving and speaking with officers, his legs outward and non-combative with Officer Schifelbein standing behind him. The arrestee had multiple minor cuts and abrasions on his hands and feet, was wearing grey gym shorts, a red t-shirt and no shoes. 

Officer Schifelbein stated to us that the arrestee had stated to him that the arrestee was using PCP and that Officer Schifelbein had called for Plano FD and that they were en route. Minutes later Plano FD arrived at the location and with handcuffs on, lifted and placed the arrestee onto a gurney, strapped the arrestee in, and then placed the gurney with the arrestee into the ambulance. Before being placed on the gurney officers asked FD if they wanted the handcuffs removed and
paramedics replied no for safety purposes. 

The arrestee was lying on his back with his arms behind him still restrained and was left that way for as long as he was in the ambulance. I rode inside the ambulance to ensure the safety of all that were in the ambulance while Officer Kermes followed behind us. While en route, I asked the paramedics several times if they wanted me to remove the restraints and they replied no. I in no way touched the arrestee en route to MCP and only observed the paramedics administer an IV and later CPR.

After arriving at MCP, I observed paramedics, doctors and nurses transport the arrestee out of the ambulance and into a hospital room and it was there that I unlocked the arrestees restraints. Doctors rolled the arrestee onto his right side where I could reach the lock and I released the arrestees hands from the handcuffs. At that point officers left the room and called for CSI and CID. Shortly after, the arrestee was pronounced dead by doctors and transported to another room. CSI arrived and took pictures of the body and shortly after I spoke to Medical Examiner Laray. I stated to the ME all that had transpired that I had observed as well as the arrestees information. 

The ME asked me about restraints that were used on the arrestee, positions the arrestee had
been in, injuries to the arrestee and narcotics that were in the arrestees system. The ME also recorded Officer Schifelbeins information and my information. Shortly afterward we were relieved by other officers and arrived at 800 where we were debriefed.",ab,d,1,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/c8b031a6bcbb4291ad61ad7b411b5374.jpg,"65,41,396,433"

No grand jury","On November 7, 20011 at approximately 8:00pm, Richardson Police Officers responded to a hit and run accident at the intersection of East Belt Line road and North Bowser road. During the course of the investigation, officers were informed by a witness that a person who was later identified as Jonas Hernandez had committed the offense of Burglary of a Habitation. 

The Richardson Officers attempted to detain Hernandez but he became combative and resisted arrest. It took three officers to gain control of Hernandez in order to handcuff him and place him in a patrol car. The officers then transported Hernandez to the Plano Municipal Jail.

At the time of the incident, the City of Richardson and the City of Plano Police department had an Interlocal Agreement which allowed for the housing of Richardson's inmates at the Plano Municipal Jail During the remodeling of the jail facility. There were two or three Richardson detention Officers on duty in the Plano Municipal Jail at all times to facilitate the care and custody of Richardson's inmates.

While being transported to the Plano Municipal Jail; Hernandez was vocal and appeared to be agitated. He arrived at the Plano Municipal Jail at 8:33 pm and would not obey verbal commands from the officers which resulted in the officers need to physically remove him from the vehicle.
Once inside the vestibule area of the Plano Municipal Jail, Hernandez began to comply with verbal commands from the officers and appeared to calm down. 

Officers attempted to remove the handcuffs and Hernandez began to resist and again became non-compliant. Hernandez was escorted to a padded cell and placed on the floor in an effort to finish removing the handcuffs. The officers then attempted to place Hernandez in a restraint
chair. Hernandez was flailing his head side to side and arching his back to avoid being secured into the restraint chair. a detention supervisor applied a mandibular pressure point maneuver on Hernandez in an effort to prevent him from continuing to resist the chair restraints. Once Hernandez was secured, he stopped yelling and resisting. A detention officer noticed that he looked pale and his pupils were dilated. EMS was contacted at 8:48pm and responded at 8: 54pm. They determined that Hernandez did not have a pulse and started performing CPR prior to transporting him to Plano Medical Center. 

On November 9th, 2011, Hernandez was pronounced death by attending physician. Hospital tests indicated that Hernandez was positive for cocaine and the preliminary results from the Collin
County Medical Examiner list the Manner of death as "" accidental"" and the cause of death as "" toxic effects of cocaine with acute psychosis.""",ab,d,,,,

The location where the unknown type of medical assistance was needed was reported to be 1511 10th Street in Orange, Texas. As is standard procedure when a call such as this is received the communications division dispatched medical response units from the Orange Fire and Rescue and Acadian Ambulance Service. As most emergencies reported in this manner are medical in nature law enforcement is not dispatched initially to a call such as this. 

Upon their arrival at 9:58 a.m. the first responders could hear an elderly female screaming for help. It was obvious to the responders that the female was in distress not from a medical condition but from a threat from another person in the residence. The responders, as is standard procedure in an event such as this, contacted law enforcement and retreated so that the scene could be secured by police personnel. 

First responders are not armed or trained to deal with violent suspects. When the call was broadcast Officers Howard DeVault and Michael Roush of the Orange Police Department responded as did the Constable of Orange County Precinct One, Keith Merritt. Approximately 10:00 a.m., the three officers arrived and they could also hear the female in distress and calling for help. Given the exigency of the situation the officers entered the residence to further assess the situation and to offer assistance to the female who was calling out for help. 

Upon making entry through an unlocked door the officers observed an elderly female victim, later identified as Lillian Barnett, and male suspect, later identified as Jerry Lynn Jones. Jones and Barnett were thrashing around on the floor in the living room. They were both under a yellow colored blanket. At this point Jones did not appear to be inflicting any injuries that at the time were likely to cause death or serious bodily injury to Ms. Barnett but he continued to try to confine her beneath him. It was apparent to the Officers that Jones was not acting reasonably and they were extremely concerned as to what his next actions would be.

 It was obvious that the actions of Jones had Ms. Barnett restrained against her will as she was continuing to call out for assistance in getting away from Jones. The officers gave verbal commands for both Jones to show his hands. The victim (Ms. Barnett) was very upset and continued to ask for help. Jones told officers that he had run out the back door of the residence. There had been no reports or indications of anyone fleeing the residence and Jones statements did not seem logical or truthful. 

Jones was grasping Barnetts nightgown and would not let go. He would not follow any verbal instructions. Jones was positioned so that he had his body over the top of Ms. Barnett and they continued writhing on the floor. Jones appeared to be wrapping his legs around Barnett in a further attempt to restrain her. It was obvious to officers that Jones was the aggressor and Ms. Barnett was a victim. It was not apparent if Jones had any weapons beneath the blanket. 

At this point Officers Roush and Merritt, with duty weapons drawn, covered Officer DeVault as Officer DeVault holstered his duty firearm and extracted his departmentally issued Taser from a holster on his duty belt. Jones and Ms. Barnett were in such close proximity and moving in such a way that Officer DeVault chose to seek another way (physical intervention) to gain Ms. Barnetts freedom without jeopardizing her safety further. The officers were still uncertain as to any weapons that may be beneath the blanket. The Taser was not utilized initially. The officers attempted to restrain Jones and to place handcuffs on him but he continued to resist and was uncooperative. 

Jones rolled onto his stomach holding onto Barnett. Officers Roush and Merritt were able to get one handcuff on Jones but his continued resistance prohibited them from securing the other hand. Ms. Barnett was able to get free as Officers attempted to gain physical control of Jones. At this point Officer DeVault elected to deploy and utilize his Taser in order to gain compliance from Jones. Even after being stunned by the Taser Jones continued to ignore verbal commands and he remained physically combative. 

Officer DeVault has been trained in the proper use of the Taser and he holds a current certificate in its use Utilizing his training he chose to utilize what is known as the drive stun method. This involves removing the standard cartridge that is normally fired from the Taser and to place the Taser into direct contact with the individual prior to its utilization. In the drive stun use the Taser is placed in direct contact to the person and there is no discharge of the projectiles and the contact is directly from the device to the person with no penetration by the darts in a traditional use of the Taser. 

Officer DeVault accomplished the drive stun utilization by placing the device on Jones right bicep. Jones was stunned for about two seconds but he still was not compliant so Officer DeVault placed the device on Jones lower back for another one to two second stun. At this time officers were able to place handcuffs on Jones. Jones was given a few moments to get over the stun but he still refused to cooperate with officers. He continued to physically resist. 

He was not incapacitated as he remained combative. After Jones was secured officers were able to speak with Ms. Barnett. She advised them that she did not know Jerry Jones and that she had never seen him before in her life. She advised he had unlawfully entered her home and attacked her. She stated that she had gone outside to retrieve her mail and that he followed her inside as she returned to her residence. She stated that he acted strangely and he physically assaulted her. She told officers that she activated her medical alert button in an attempt to summon help. 

She was very distraught but did indicate that she desired to file charges against Jones for his unlawful entry to her residence and for the assault upon her person. 

Outside the residence Jerry Jones remained uncooperative and kept kicking at officers. Sgt. Wade Robinson and Sgt. JohnDee Taylor of the Orange Police Department arrived on the scene to provide assistance. They, along with Officer Roush, attempted to check Jones for weapons or drugs. Jones continued to kick at the officers and to roll around on the ground. A check of Jones left front pants pocket revealed a small brown paper bag. Inside the bag was a copper mesh material that is commonly used in the process of smoking crack cocaine. 

Due to Jones continually kicking at officers and to prevent injury to the officers or to Jones himself, the Officers utilized a hobble restraint so that Jones leg movements were restricted. The hobble device was placed around both ankles by Officer Roush. The hobble was attached to the handcuffs behind Jones back. The officer noted the hobble was long enough to let Jones place his legs down, but left short so he could not kick. He had enough mobility to roll onto his side or to get into any position he desired. The hobble was only applied so that it restricted his ability to kick the officers. 

After Jones was secured it was determined Jones would be placed under arrest for Burglary of Habitation. In less than two minutes of being hobbled, Officer DeVault noticed that Jones was unresponsive. 

Officer DeVault asked Acadian Ambulance personnel to check Jones. The restraints were removed and an EKG device was utilized to check his vital signs. Sufficient vital signs could not be found so ambulance personnel started CPR. Jones was placed in the ambulance and transported to the Memorial Herman Baptist Hospital - Orange. He was treated by the hospital staff for about an hour. He was pronounced as being deceased at 11:44 a.m. the same day. 

It should be noted that officers fo the Orange police department had encountered Jones approximately an hour earlier after Jones had a disagreement with his common law wife at Wachovia bank on 16th street in Orange. At that time Jones did not appear to be disoriented, combative, or adversely under the influence of any intoxicants. Donna Peveto was arrested for a motion to revoke probation (MTRP) warrant from Travis County and Jones was allowed to leave the scene. At the time of this occurrence Jones had in his possession an official photo identification card issued by the State of Louisiana. The identification card displayed the number of 00952788. 

A subsequent Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) check showed a National Crime Information Center (NCIS) identification number for Jerry Jones of 02819577. It should also be noted that this identification was confirmed by actual fingerprint comparisons of the deceased and of the individual named through NCIC and AFIS as Jerry Jones. An autopsy was ordered by Judge Joe Parkhurst who is the Justice of Peace Precinct One in Orange County, Texas. The initial autopsy was conducted by the Jefferson County Medical Examiners Office. The initial report from the Pathologist revealed that no signs of trauma or pre-existing condition that would cause death. A final determination would not be available until the results of toxicology examinations.  The Orange Police Department has since received a report from the pathologist that indicates that Jones died as a result of ingesting lethal amounts of cocaine. The manner of death was ruled accident.",tp,d,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/80fc1cb1b9da448aadf4458707df4f97.jpg,"107,19,451,427"

Upon the arrival of two uniformed Nassau Bay Police Officers, officers observed the male subject, later identified as Steven Hayes (01/13/1956) 55 years old sitting on a sofa banging his hands on the coffee table and yelling for no apparent reason. Due to the bizarre behavior of the subject, officers requested that the Nassau Bay EMS crew be dispatched to the scene. 

Officers attempted to place the subject into protective custody at which time he became violent and resisted being handcuffed. One officer deployed his Taser model X-26 which had little effect on the subject. Due to the continued combative nature of the subject, the officer activated his Taser additional times which still did not bring the subject into compliance. 

Officers, with assistance from additional units that had arrived on scene, were able to subdue the subject and secure him to a backboard fro transportation to an area hospital. 

Prior to being loaded into the ambulance, the subject appeared to be in distress and later went into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing. CPR was started immediately by the Nassau Bay EMS crew and the subject was transported to St. John Hospital located at 18300 St. John Drive, Nassau Bay, Texas 77058 where he was treated and placed into the intensive care unit.

MPD Officer A. Espinoza was on foot pursuit and he was yelling at Mr. Olvera to stop running. MPD Officer A. Espinoza moments later lost sight of him. MPD Investigator V.

DOB 3/4/1943

Would not have been charged with anything","Per officer description of events leading up to the subjects death:
Off-duty officer had just completed his 6am 6pm night shift and was traveling to his home, riding his personal motorcycle. Approximately five miles from the police department, the officer began passing a pickup truck pulling a trailer loaded with lumber. As he passed the truck, the driver swerved toward the officer causing him to take evasive action. 

Upon regaining control of his motorcycle the officer passed the pickup truck and accelerated to put distance between him and the pickup truck. Upon entering the next town the officer was forced to slow down due to speed limit reduction. At that time the driver of the pickup truck accelerated and
again swerved at the officer. This action continued for another several miles until the officer was able to retrieve his badge from his duty belt, as he was wearing cold weather gear, and identify himself as a police officer.

Once the driver stopped on the shoulder of the road, the officer stopped in front of the subjects vehicle and fully identified himself as a police officer and told him to step out of his vehicle, which the subject complied with. When asked by the officer, why were you trying to run me off the road the subject stated, I didn't know you were a police officer, and your headlight is too bright. 

At that time the subject was handcuffed and told that he was under arrest for assault with a deadly weapon. At that time a Navarro County Sheriffs Officer arrived and stated that no one was under arrest and removed the officers handcuffs. The subject was then told to sit back in his vehicle, where the Navarro County deputy questioned him for ten to fifteen minutes. While he was being questioned by the deputy, the subject became unresponsive and stopped breathing. 

Cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was then performed by one of the Navarro County deputies and the Malakoff off-duty officer. CPR continued until Corsicana EMS arrived and transported the subject to Navarro Regional Hospital, where he expired.",ab,d,,,,

When writer approached FM 519 from Westward, writer observed a white-colored utility vehicle parked in the 2800 block of FM 519 on the north bound side of the roadway, facing west bound. The vehicle had the emergency flashers activated and the writer pulled along the side of the vehicle and spoke with Pope. As writer began to speak with Pope, Officer Garcia mentioned that he had visuals on the subject. When writer began to speak with Pope, Pope informed writer that the subject was rolling around on the ground, and that he seemed to be messed up on crack cocaine. 

As soon as Pope made the statement, Pope advised writer that writer needed to assist his partner. Writer looked across the street and observed Office Garcias marked patrol unit parked in the driveway of 2729 FM 519, facing south bound. 

The said location is an apartment complex, located on the south bound side of the roadway. Officer Garcia was exiting his marked patrol unit and writer observed a black male subject standing in front of the unit. The subject was later identified as Jamaal Ray Valentine (B/M, DOB 01-30-82). Valentine began to run towards the passenger side of the marked patrol unit, and writer immediately responded to Officer Garcias location. As writer drove across the street and parked his marked patrol unit in the east bound lane of travel, Officer Garcia asked writer on the radio for a taser. 

Writer advised Officer Garcia that he was equipped with the X26 Taser (#2). Writer exited his marked patrol unit and left the door ajar as it was facing east bound. As writer approached Officer Garcias and Valentines location, Officer Garcia was advising Valentine to give him his hands. At this time, Valentine was sitting on the ground and making unknown statements. Officer Garcia was able to grab his right hand, and when Officer Garcia attempted to grab his left hand, Valentine became even more combative. 

Writer told Officer Garcia to step back so that writer could deploy the X26 Taser. Officer Garcia advised writer to hold on due to Officer Garcia still being in close contact with Valentine and having possession of his right hand. Once Officer Garcia released Valentines right hand, writer issued valentine verbal commands to lie on the ground in a prone position and comply. Valentine failed to comply and writer stated that Valentine would be tased if he did not comply. 

Due to Valentine failing to comply after several verbal commands, writer deployed the X26 Taser (Cartridge #: T08-2069907). The X26 Taser was deployed due to Officers exhausting the means of Officer Presence, Verbal Commands, and Soft Hand Control. The purpose of the X26 Taser is a tool for Officer safety, so that the subject could be incapacitated to avoid Officer injuries. The X26 Taser was deployed from a few feet away, and the two prong darts struck the subject on the torso. 

During the first five-second cycle, Valentine rolled onto his stomach and began making unknown statements. Writer was unable to determine what was being said, and after the first five-second cycle was finished, Valentine attempted to push himself up off the ground by his hands. Both Officers advised Valentine to lie back down on the ground, and Valentine failed to comply. Writer deployed an additional five-second cycle, and Valentine rolled back onto his stomach. 

Valentine was still making unknown statements, and after the second cycle was finished, Valentine attempted to stand back up. Valentine still did not comply to the verbal commands, and a third cycle was deployed. After the five second so the third cycle was over, Valentine was able to stand up and remove the two prong darts. 

At this time, Officer Garcia jumped on Valentines back, and he was taken to ground near a concrete curb and grassy area. The location was several feet away from Officer Garcias marked patrol unit, and it was located on the west bound side of the driveway. Prior to Valentine standing up, writer and Officer Garcia were attempting to keep Valentine on the ground by using soft hand control techniques. The techniques were not working, and Valentine was able to kick writer in the groin. Writer fell back and almost landed in the gravel on his buttocks. 

As writer fell back, thats when Valentine stood up. Writer had Valentines shoe impressions on his shorts, and digital photographs were taken by Deputy OBriant of the Galveston County Sheriffs Office Identification Division. During the process of writer attempting to assist Officer Garcia, writer contacted Dispatcher Scott, via radio, and requested assistance from the Texas City and Hitchcock Police Departments. Writers handheld microphone was pulled off of his duty shirt lapel by Valentine.

While Officer Garcia was trying to subdue Valentine on the ground, writer tried to drive stun Valentine. During the process of writer trying to drive stun Valentine with the X26 Taser, writer drive stunned Officer Garcia several times. The drive stun by the X26 Taser is another pain compliance technique. Once writer realized that Officer Garcia was being drive stunned, writer discarded his X26 Taser. 
Once the X26 Taser was discarded, writer attempted to grab Valentine by the arms so that Officers could gain control of his hands. During the process, Valentine was extremely out of control, and verbal commands were no effect as well as the hard empty hand control strikes by Officer Garcia. 

As Officer Garcia struck Valentine with a closed fist, Valentine grabbed writer by the front of his uniform shirt and tried to pull the writer close to his face. Writer was able to push Valentine back, and writer felt Valentine grab his duty weapon and holster. Writer felt Valentine pulling on both items with a strong force, and writer was in fear of his life that Valentine was going to gain control of his service weapon (Sig Sauer P229 .40 caliber semi automatic).  

At this point, writer grabbed his on-duty flashlight (#4) that is issued by the Police Department and attempted to strike Valentine in the right shoulder as a pain compliance technique to release writers holster and service weapon. As writer was in the process of striking Valentine, Valentine used writers holster and nylon duty rig to pull himself up off of the ground. As Valentine was pulling himself up, writer struck Valentine on the top portion of his head with the flashlight. 

Valentine fell back onto the ground and continued to struggle with Officers.

As writer and Officer Garcia continued to struggle with Valentine, writer noticed officer Gandy #37 arrive on scene. Officer Gandy parked his marked patrol unit directly behind the writers. Dispatcher Krenek was riding with Officer Gandy in his patrol unit and was present during the struggle. Dispatcher Krenek sat in the marked patrol unit during the incident and observed all three Officers struggling with Valentine. During this whole incident, all Officers kept advising Valentine to stop struggling and to comply by giving his hands. Due to Valentine still not complying, writer attempted to use the flashlight as an impact weapon to strike Valentine on the right rear shoulder. 

The purpose of the strike was to allow Officers to gain control of Valentines hands from under his torso. Due to Valentine not complying, writer was also in fear of his life due to writer believing that Valentine might have a weapon in his waistband. As writer attempted to strike Valentine in the above mentioned location, writer struck Valentine on the back portion of his head, due to Valentine moving all around.

Since writer was unable to use pain compliance technique, writer discarded the flashlight and attempted to remove Valentines hands from his torso once again. The soft empty hand control techniques were still complying while all three Officers were attempting to use them at the same time. Due to Valentines actions and strength, writer believes Valentine was under the influence of an illegal narcotic. When writer first approached Valentine, Valentine was speaking with a slurred speech, and he had saliva coming from his mouth. Valentine was a large framed black male subject who showed to be 6'0"" and 230-250 pounds. Since the soft hand control techniques were not working, writer grabbed his ASP baton from his duty right and attempted to pry Valentines hands from under his torso. Writer first attempted to remove Valentines right arm from being pinned under his body, and it did not work. Valentine continued to use a large amount of force towards Officers, and the technique was not working. Writer then attempted the technique again on the right arm, and writer was finally able to remove Valentines arm from under his torso. 

At this point, Officer Gandy was able to secure a handcuff on Valentines right wrist. Once the handcuff was on Valentines right wrist, writer began to use the same technique on Valentines left arm. After struggling with Valentine for an unknown period of time, writer was able to pry Valentines left arm from under his torso.
Valentines left wrist was secured in handcuffs, and Officer Garcia retrieved leg restraints from his marked patrol unit. Leg restraints were placed on Valentine because Valentine was still being combative.

During the process of Valentine lying on his back while being restrained, Valentine still showed to be a threat due to his behavior. Somehow, Valentine was able to roll onto his stomach and make an attempt to flee.

Valentine kept trying to get up, and writer rested both of his knees on the back portion of Valentines legs. As writer was doing this, Officer Gandy rested his body on the back portion of Valentines back.
Writer then contacted Dispatcher Scott and requested La Marque EMS to arrive on the scene. Officer Gandy informed Dispatcher Scott that Valentine had a laceration to his head. 

La Marque EMS Medic One arrived on scene and subdued Valentine to a gurney with Spyder Straps due to his combativeness. Officer Gandy was requested to ride with La Marque EMS Medic One to the hospital in case Valentine became even more combative. 

Once Valentine was secured in the ambulance, writer walked over to some subjects standing
outside of the apartments and asked if they knew Valentine. The subjects stated that they did not know Valentine nor did they know where he came from. Officer Walton #38 had already spoken with the subjects, including Pope. Writer did notice Nathaniel Ray (B/M, DOB 09-09-87) standing at the apartments and was aware that Ray resides at 2012 Bellview, La Marque, Texas 77568. Ray is known by Officers of the La Marque Police Department to engage in the illegal sale of narcotics from that residence.

After La Marque EMS Medic One transported Valentine to Mainland Center hospital, located at 6801 EFL Expressway, Texas City, Texas 77591, writer and officer Garcia returned to the La Marque Police Department, located at 431 Bayou Road. Writer had Dispatcher Krenek drive Officer Gandys marked patrol unit to the Police Department, since Officer Gandy was riding with La Marque Ems Medic One. 

Once at the Police Department, writer contacted Lt. Gilchrist #03, Lt. Jackson #02, and Chief Price. All three parties were notified of the incident, and writer was instructed to contact the on-call ADA Intake. While writer was speaking with ADA, Kayla Allen, writer was informed by Officer Gandy that Valentine had stopped breathing while being transported to Mainland Center Hospital. Officer Gandy mentioned that he assisted the medics with CPR, and Valentine was now deceased. 

Writer told ADA Kayla Allen of th outcome, and she told writer that she was going to contact ADA Joel Bennett, and that she would contact the writer back. Ada Kayla Allen contacted writer back a few minutes later and stated that writer needed to secure the scene and both ADAs would be en route.

Writer then contacted Chief Price and advised him of the outcome. Chief Price mentioned that he would meet with writer at the scene. Writer, Officer Garcia, lt. Gilchrist, and Detective Currington drove to the scene andsecured it with yellow crime scene tape. Detective Currington began to process the scene and then ADA Joel Bennett arrived. 

ADA Joel Bennett advised Chief Price that he was going to contact the Galveston County Sheriffs Office to investigate the scene.

An unknown time later, Deputy OBriant arrived on scene and took digital photographs. Deputy OBriant
retrieved DNA samples from writers service weapon and holster. Deputy OBriant took several digital
photographs of writers uniform, injuries, and then took possession of writers ASP baton, flashlight, and spent X26 Taser cartridge. 

At this time, writer and Officer Garcia were able to leave the scene and return to the La Marque Police
Department. Once at the Police Department, writer finished cleaning blood from writers person. While on the scene, writer was able to clean some of the blood off of his person by hydrogen peroxide. Officer Gandy returned to the Police Department, and writer collected the On Job Injury forms so that all Officers involved could be treated at Mainland Center Hospital. 

Detective Price transported writer, Officer Garcia, and Officer Gandy to the hospital and were treated by medical personnel for the blood exposure. The On Job Injury forms were completed and returned to the Police Department. Writer sustained small cuts to the right knee and a jammed left thumb.
 
Writer returned to the Police Department and completed his Offense Report, Use of Force Report, and Taser Deployment forms. At this time, the case will remain active, and writers uniform was submitted for evidence.",tp,d,1,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/44ff7f663bd748b59faaba08fde2c0ea.jpg,"11,35,421,521"

Upon Officer Mendezs arrival, he was approached by an HFD paramedic who handed him a pistol that he removed from the suspects sister. 

Officer Mendez secured the weapon in his patrol car and returned to the front entrance of the residence. When Officer Mendez walked inside, he observed that the suspect was lying on the living room floor in his underwear while his brother was holding him down and restraining him. 

Officer Mendez saw that the suspect was bleeding from a laceration to his forehead area. Officer Mendez, with the assistance of the suspects brother, rolled him over and placed one handcuff on his wrist. The suspect became violent once again and Officer Mendez requested assistance over the police radio. 

Officer K. Strange, riding unit #6B22D, answered the call and drove to the location. Prior to Officer Stranges arrival, Officer Mendez managed to get the second hand cuff on the suspect. Officer Mendez got back on the police radio and disregarded any other units rushing to his aid. At this point, the suspect sat up and leaned against a couch in the living room area. Officer Mendez did not use any physical force on the suspect other than handcuffing him. 

After the scene was under control, Officer Mendez began his preliminary investigation and he learned that the suspect had assaulted his seventy-one year old mother by pulling her off of her bed and sitting on her. The complainant managed to get to her phone and she called her son who resides in a nearby house. 

The complainants son walked inside and pulled the suspect off of his mother and a fight ensued at that point. During the struggle, the suspect sustained a superficial wound to his forehead area. 

The suspects sister called 911 to report the incident and police and fire personnel were summoned to the scene. Officer Mendez learned that the suspect struggled with an addiction to crack cocaine. 

Officer Mendez called the Harris County District attorneys office and charges of assault were accepted on the suspect for assaulting his mother. Due to the fact that the suspect sustained an injury to his head during his struggle with his brother, Officer Mendez decided to transport the suspect to Ben Taub Hospital to have his head examined before being booked in jail. The suspect stood up and walked to Officer Mendezs patrol car under his own power. Due to the suspect's size, it was decided that Officer Strange would transport the suspect in his patrol SUV. 

The suspect resisted by refusing to enter the vehicle. Both officers, with the assistance of HFD personnel, laid the suspect down on the cars seat, and they pulled him in from the opposite side of the patrol car. The suspect was allowed to lie on his left side and it was decided that seat belting him in created more potential danger to officers and paramedics. 

Officer Strange transported the suspect to Ben Taub Hospital while Officer Mendez followed him in a separate patrol car. Upon their arrival to Ben Taub Hospital, the suspect got out of the patrol car under his own power and he sat down on the curb. 

Medical personnel at the hospital assisted the officers by bringing out a stretcher. Soon after their arrival, it became apparent to the hospital staff that the suspects condition began to rapidly deteriorate. The suspect was taken into a shock room where he eventually went into cardiac arrest. The suspect died while at Ben Taub Hospital due to unknown medical reasons. 

The Homicide Division was notified of the incident and a team of investigators were assigned to investigate. A criminal history check on the suspect revealed previous arrests for possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) and driving with his license suspended.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/fabaca183bfd40e0875063a6bf387c4e.jpg,"0,28,585,722"

entered the La Rinconcito Bar at 8102 Irvington and was exhibiting both delusional and physical medical problems. 

The decedent began harassing the patrons at the bar, grabbing them and claiming that he was being chased by people who wanted to kill him. None of the witnesses saw anyone chasing or attempting to harm him. 

After escorting the decedent out of the bar and calling police and fire personnel, the witnesses watched the the decedent crawl underneath a vehicle. The decedent began to claim that someone was under the vehicle with him, trying to hurt him. HFD paramedics arrived and attempted to render aid to the decedent but he became combative with the paramedics.

Houston Police Officer Jose Luis-Menendez arrived after being called to the scene by another employee of the bar requesting police assistance. Officer Menendez approached the firemen and the decedent in order to assess the scene. Officer Menendez determined that the decedent, due to what appeared to be an altered mental state from an unknown cause, was hindering the firemen's ability to provide him with medical attention. Subsequently, for the immediate purpose of helping the firemen provide the decedent with aid, Officer Menendez placed handcuff restraints on the decedent. 

According to witnesses and paramedics, Officer Menedez restrained the decedent for less than a minute. While the officer and paramedics were both holding the decedent on the ground, the decedent lost consciousness and lost his pulse. 

At the moment that the decedent appeared to fall into medical crisis, Officer Menendez immediately removed his handcuffs from the decedent so that paramedics could more effectively provide him with medical care. HFD personnel began CPR on the decedent and transported him to LBJ Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The man, later identified as the decedent, Ramiro Rodriguez Garcia, told Ms. Aguilar that he needed help and to come on. Ms. Aguilar said that she attempted to find out what the decedent needed help with but refused to leave the protective area of the office and approach him. She added that the decedent had wet hair and huge eyes. Instead, Ms. Aguilar contacted 911 for assistance. After her initial call for service, Ms. Aguilar said she called 911 a second time to report that the decedent kept placing his hand into his pocket and she wanted officers to know he may have a weapon. Houston Fire Department (HFD) Engine 053 arrived on scene first. Firefighters attempted to help the decedent but he steadfastly refused to let them examine him. Officer Tovar was the first Houston Police officer on scene and arrived at approximately 11:40 p.m. He and the other four officers involved in this incident were in full uniform, driving marked Houston Police vehicles. Officer Tovar said that the decedent was sweaty and had a glazed look in his eyes, that he was barefoot and had cuts on his feet and although there was no apparent language barrier the decedent was slow to respond to Officer Tovar. Officer Tovar said he felt that the decedent may have been under the influence of some sort of intoxicant. Officer Tovar said he asked the decedent if he needed help, if he could contact a relative for him or provide a courtesy ride somewhere. The decedent continued to refuse assistance. At one point, the decedent told the the officers and HFD that he was thirsty and was provided a drink of water by a firefighter. The decedent did not drink the water. Officer Pruitt, the primary unit and second officer on scene, arrived at approximately 11:47 p.m. He stated that he and Officer Tovar continued to try and convince the decedent to let HFD employees take his vital signs and help him but the decedent appeared to be confused and was non-compliant. Officer Tovar asked for additional units to check by after the decedent told him that he was not going anywhere and that it would be on. He felt that the decedent was warning him that he would get combative if the officers tried to escort him anywhere. Officers Fletcher and Raska arrived on scene at approximately 11:57 p.m. Both officers stated that their assessment of the decedent (sweating profusely, glazed eyes, incoherent daze) was that he was under the influence of an unknown drug or substance, that he was a danger to himself or others and that he should be evaluated medically. Verbal attempts to have the decedent comply were unsuccessful and the officers decided to detain him. The decedent resisted the officers efforts to be taken into custody and he was taken to the ground. The officers were unable to handcuff the decedent and at one point in the struggle Officer Fletcher deployed his Taser in drive stun mode. The deployment had no apparent effect on the decedent and he continued his struggle with the officers. Officer Fletcher said that his Taser is not working at which point Officer Raska deployed his Taser (drive stun mode) in the decedents lower back near his waist. The deployment had no apparent effect and Officer Raska deployed his Taser (drive stun mode) a second time in the same area. Again the Taser had no apparent effect and he deployed it a third time in drive stun mode on the decedents upper back. There was still no apparent effect and the decedent continued to struggle for a time until officers were able to place handcuffs on him. The decedent was placed in a sitting position against a brick post and HFD employees immediately began attending to him by providing oxygen and taking his vital signs. HFD also called a medical unit to the scene to transport the decedent, while the officers called for a supervisor. Upon arrival of HFD A044, the decedent was placed face up onto a gurney and was being loaded into the ambulance when he became combative again. He began kicking on the gurney, at which point Officer Raska said he placed leg restraints on the decedents feet, securing his legs to the gurney. HFD asked that an officer accompany them in the ambulance. Officer Pruitt agreed to do so and as he entered the ambulance was told that the decedent had stopped breathing and they were initiating Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation. Officer Pruitt removed the handcuffs while an HFD employee removed the leg restraint. HFD transported the decedent to East Houston Medical Center, which is adjacent to the Interstate Motor Lodge. Arrival time at the Emergency Center was approximately 12:27 a.m. on August 1, 2012.

Elliott and Officer Z. Crowder heard over the radio a Code 1 Assault in Progress call drop at 3525 Lockwood Dr., the Salina Food Mart, and volunteered to take the call. 

Upon arrival, officers noticed a large crowd near the entrance to the store and three males attempting to restrain a black male, later identified as Michael Wayne Simmons King. 

Officers J. Elliott and Z. Crowder told the three males to let Mr. King go and attempted to place him in handcuffs. Officer Elliott was able to get one hand cuffed, when Mr. King started tensing his body and pulling away from Officer Elliott. 

Officer Crowder assisted Officer Elliott in trying to place Mr. King's hands behind his back, but could not get Mr. King to cooperate. Mr. King was holding a glass crack pipe that was broken on one end in one of his hands. While he was resisting officers' attempts to restrain him, Officer Crowder was cut on his thumb by the pipe. 

Officers were able to safely remove the pipe from Mr. King's hands soon after. Officer Crowder told Mr. King that he would knee him to gain compliance if Mr. King did not place his hands behind his back, and when he didn't, Officer Crowder delivered three knee strikes to the abdomen of Mr. King. Mr. King then told officers he would cooperate and officers were able to handcuff Mr. King. Officer Elliott got on his radio and requested HFD to check by and evaluate Mr. King. 

After being evaluated and cleared by HFD, Officer Elliott and Crowder walked Mr. King to their patrol vehicle and placed him in the back seat, seat belting him in. Officer Crowder contacted the District Attorney's office and ADA Otto accepted PCS charges on Mr. King after a crack pipe was discovered in his hand. 

Officer Elliott drove the patrol vehicle a block south to complete the booking blotter and jail initialization process and saw that Mr. King was sitting up straight in the back seat. Officers drove to Central Jail and when they got out of the vehicle to remove Mr. King, Officer Elliott noticed that Mr. King had his head looking down and was unresponsive and drooling. 

Officer Elliott attempted to awaken Mr. King and felt for a pulse, finding none. Officer Crowder removed the handcuffs and began to administer CPR while Officer Elliott ran to get medical attention from the jail and also radioed for HFD. HFD arrived at Central Jail and took over CPR and transported Mr. King to St. Joseph's Hospital. Officer Elliott and Officer Crowder followed the ambulance to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 8:55 p.m. by Dr. Alagarsamy.

 Mr. King has a criminal history spanning from 1992 to 2011 and is a registered sex offender. His criminal charges include Stalking, Indecency with a child, Assault Family Member/Impeding Breath, and Failure to register as a sex offender. A search of his criminal history shows that he has been in the custody of TDCJ Huntsville. Mr. King's status as a known mental health consumer within HPD records is still pending.",ed,,,,,

Kessler riding unit 70Z21, responded to a traffic hazard call initiated by Transtar where a male was observed to be walking in traffic on the 1700 block of the South Loop West. Officer Kessler arrived and found a very agitated white male that claimed to be under gun fire and appeared to be under the influence of some type of drugs. Officer Kessler made contact with the male who was not wearing a shirt but was making the motion of trying to take off his shirt. The male then told Officer Kessler to get down so he would not get shot. Officer Kessler then attempted to calm the male down and instead the male attempted to get into the open driver's door of officer Kessler's patrol car, which was still running. Officer Kessler then grabbed the male in a head lock in order to prevent him from getting in the patrol car and in order to place him in custody. Officer Kessler was able to get one handcuff on the male but the male managed to get away from officer Kessler. The male then ran into traffic and jumped off the freeway falling
approximately 17 feet onto the service road. The male then ran into the parking lot of a McDonald's restaurant where he was met by off-duty Texas Southern University Police department Sergeant S. James,Unit 102 and off-duty Harris County Sheriffs deputy, R.K. Lennox,Unit 40T2, who were working an extra-job at the location. The two off-duty peace officers spotted the male and also attempted to place the male into custody. Officer Kessler drove down from the freeway and with assistance from the two off-duty peace officers, Houston Police officer G.A. Watson, riding unit I5E48B, and Houston Police sergeant C. Yorloff, riding unit I5E06E, was finally able to place the male into custody. During the arrest, officer Kessler used his Taser in dry stun mode discharging it four times with little apparent
effect. At some point while the male was handcuffed and in custody, he stopped breathing. Paramedics from the Houston Fire Department ambulance number 33, who were already at the scene and speaking with the male, began C.P.R. The male was stabilized and transported to Ben Taub Hospital for treatment. Officer Kessler then proceeded to Ben Taub Hospital in order to check on the suspect. Officer Kessler found the male being treated in bed #14 of the Intensive Care Unit located on level 4E. Officer Kessler was informed that the suspect had been sedated to keep him from moving around and that toxicology and urine samples had been ordered. Officer Kessler then contacted the Harris County District Attorney's Office and presented the case to Assistant District Attorney (ADA) J. Ortiz for charges. Officer Kessler was advised by ADA Ortiz that due to the suspect's medical condition he would not accept charges at that time and that a to-be warrant could be filed later.
On November 11, 2006 the Homicide office received a phone call from Investigator Jones of the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office. Investigator Jones stated that their office had been contacted by Ben Taub Hospital and advised that Michael Dean Ford Jr. had expired. Houston Police Lieutenant J.R. Levingston reviewed the case and assigned Officer R. Cervantes and Sergeant M. Cruz to make the scene at the hospital. HPD personnel conducted the hospital investigation and made contact with the Medical Examiner's office and made arrangements to be contacted to attend the autopsy. Acting Lieutenant M.A. Montgomery of HPDs Internal Affairs Division was also advised of this incident.
Officer Cervantes and Sergeant Cruz proceeded to the Medical Examiner's office and witnessed the autopsy on November 12, 2006 at approximately 1 p.m. They were informed that the suspect had suffered multiple organ failure while at the hospital but that a cause of death ruling would remain pending because a detailed toxicology report would be needed due to the involvement of cocaine found in the suspect's system.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/da3818409a27444893bdac069a18310e.jpg,"125,22,424,377"

Mayorga-Guerrero and R. P. Johnson were
dispatched to a Burglary in Progress at a residence located at 9722 Galaxy. 

Upon their arrival, officers observed the location to be a vacant home but did observe numerous people inside. Through one of the broken windows on the front of the home, Officer Johnson instructed all the people inside to remain still and put their hands up. 

The decedent, Marion Wilson, ignored Officer Johnsons instructions by running out the back door where Officer Mayorga-Guerrero had positioned himself. 

Officer Mayorga-Guerrero announced himself instructing the decedent to stop. The decedent knocked Officer Mayorga-Guerrero to the side and ran from the location on foot. Officer Mayorga-Guerrero gave chase with his partner, Officer Johnson, following a short distance behind. The decedent ran into a densely wooded area where he fell to the ground allowing Officer Mayorga-Guerrero to catch him. 

Officer Johnson had lost sight of his partner and was unable to find him in the wooded area. The
decedent is six foot 242 pounds with Officer Mayorga-Guerrero measuring five foot five inches 145 pounds. The decedent fought with Officer Mayorga-Guerrero where at times he was on top of the Officer and was able to get the Officers flashlight away from him. Officer Johnson located the pair in the woods and instructed Officer Mayorga-Guerrero to get away from the decedent so he could deploy his taser on him. 

Officer Johnson deployed two rounds of darts into the decedent with no affect. Both officers began fighting with the decedent again eventually getting him handcuffed.

An ambulance was called to the scene due to the decedent bleeding from the head and possible taser dart injuries. Upon arrival of the ambulance, the decedent had stopped breathing. 

The decedent was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The autopsy of the decedent showed no signs on the cause of his death and is pending toxicology results. There were four other people found inside the home at the original location, 9722 Galaxy. These people admitted that the decedent was using cocaine on this day prior to the police officers arrival. All four of these people were charged with narcotic possession from this incident.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/80c829a351494a0f8c402120cbfacced.jpg,"64,7,412,420"

Upon arrival, officers observed the suspect walking in the public street, shouting threats and obscenities, some of which were coherent, some were not. 

When the officers gave the suspect verbal commands to comply with them and to de-escalate the disturbance, the suspect instead got more belligerent and combative. The suspect then punched and swung at one of the officers. Back-up officers deployed their department issued tazer devices at this time. The suspect, who it was learned later by family members, had injested four hits of LSD. 

The initial tazer darts were pulled out of his body by the suspect. Additional tazer deployment was then done to the suspect. This enabled three officers to finally get the suspect in custody with handcuffs. While he was seated curbside, awaiting medical assistance from HFD, the suspect went into multiple seizures. He was transported to Southeast Memorial Hospital, located at 11800 Astoria, where he would later die. On Thursday, October 10, 2013, at 5:00 p.m., Dr. Patel of Southeast Memorial Hospital pronounced Manuel Baltazars death.

P. Wilkens responded to a Disturbance with a Mental Patient call at 7609 Bywood, Houston, Harris County. 

Upon arriving that the scene, Sgt. Wilkens observed the front door of the house to be open and he could hear voices coming from the back. Sgt. Wilkens also observed broken glass all over the den floor. Sgt. Wilkens spoke with Mr. Rueven Sanders, stepfather of the decedent, Lawrence P. Crain B/M 31, who advised that the decedent was a mental patient and that his medication had recently been changed. 

Mr. Sanders stated that he called the police because the decedent was screaming that someone was going to sacrifice them and kill them and that he had also become very violent and was breaking glass. Mr. Sanders stated that the decedent needed to go to the Neuropsychiatric Center (NPC) before he hurt himself or someone else. Sgt. Wilkens found the decedent to be very unstable and at times he would tense up all his muscles and begin to scream. 

As Officers T. D. Richard and R. L. Raska arrived at the scene, Sgt. Wilkens was able to talk the decedent out of the house. As the decedent was exiting the house, he rubbed his hands across the chest of a female firefighter and groped her. Once outside the house, the responding officers were able to restrain the decedent without any resistance. 

The decedent was then placed into the patrol vehicle of Officer Raska. Once inside the patrol vehicle the decedents actions again became aggressive and his feet were secured to the bottom of the cage to prevent him from kicking out the windows. Mr. Sanders and the female firefighter did not wish to file any charges against the decedent. Officers Richard and Raska transported the decedent to the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Administration NPC so that an Emergency Commitment Order could be completed. 

While in the lobby of the center the decedent, still handcuffed, again became aggressive and officers again had to subdue him. Once the decedent was subdued, a nurse administered two medications (Haldol & Ativan) to him. 

Officers then removed the handcuffs from the decedent and the medical staff took over treating the decedent. While treating the decedent, the medical staff noticed that he had ceased breathing. CPR was administered and the decedent responded to medical treatment. The Houston Fire Department was called to the NPC and the decedent was transported to Ben Taub Hospital where he was admitted. The decedents vital signs never stabilized and at 8:19 a.m. he was pronounced dead.

Officer Graham located the decedent (later identified as Kinzy Laquinte Thornton) in the 11600 Block of Fuqua Street in the parking lot area of a Valero gas station/convenience store. Officer Graham made contact with the decedent who exhibited signs of PCP intoxication. The decedent ignored verbal commands and attempted to flee on foot. Officer Graham prevented the decedents flight and attempted to place him into custody. Four additional Houston Police Officers arrived at the scene to back up Officer Graham and assist in the arrest. During the course of the arrest, the decedent assaulted Officer Graham and Officer J. B. Heslop, unit #12D77E. The decedent continued to strike officers with his feet and fists throughout the incident until the decedent was finally brought under control with properly applied handcuffs and leg restraints. Recognizing the decedents PCP intoxication, Officer Graham requested an HFD ambulance make the scene to check the vital signs and attempt to stabilize the decedents labored breathing and distressed state.

P. Vogelpohl riding unit 3B49F on April 18, 2011, at 8:15 p.m. on-viewed a vehicle blocking a moving lane of traffic at 3800 N. Shepherd Dr. 

The vehicle was a 1996 maroon Buick Road Master. The decedent, Keith Latin, was blocking the lane by remaining stopped at a green light at the intersection of W. 38th and N. Shepherd. Officer Vogelpohl attempted to initiate a traffic stop but the vehicle did not stop right away and Officer Vogelpohl ended up following it for a distance and observed the decedent make several traffic violations. 

Officer Vogelpohl then observed the decedent run head on into the traffic light pole at the intersection of N. Durham and W. 11th. Officer Vogelpohl pulled his vehicle up to the decedents driver side door so that he could not get out. 

The decedent was violently rocking back and forth in the drivers seat throwing his arms around and screaming. Officer A. Ferrell arrived on the scene and attempted to reach into the decedents vehicle to take it out of reverse and get him out. 

The decedent turned towards the officer and started throwing punches at him. Officer Ferrell stepped back from the vehicle and deployed his conductive energy device (CED taser). At this point, Officer Vogelpohl moved up to the drivers side window and saw the decedent appeared to have been stunned by the CED. Officer Vogelpohl broke the drivers side window out with his flash light and attempted to reach into the vehicle to take it out of reverse. The decedent broke the connection to the CED and turned his attention towards Officer Vogelpohl. The decedent began screaming at Officer Vogelpohl fuck you, come get me and throwing punches at him. 

Officer Vogelpohl was unsure if the decedent had any weapons in his hands or within his reach; therefore, in order to block his punches, Officer Vogelpohl delivered cross strikes to the decedents arms with his flashlight. Officer R. Zeller deployed his CED from the passenger side and the decedent was again stunned or incapacitated by the CED. 

The officers reached into the vehicle to try and take it out of gear. The decedent started throwing punches and screaming again. The officers continued to perform cross strikes on the decedents arms to prevent him from striking the officers. A third CED was deployed. 



The decedent was incapacitated or stunned for a third time but he broke the link to the CED and came out of the vehicle. The decedents arms were raised in a fighting stance and he lunged at the officers. Using his weight against him and taking advantage of his momentum (the decedent is over 300 pounds), Officer Vogelpohl side stepped to the right and shoved the decedent towards the hood of his patrol vehicle. 

Officers Ferrell and Zeller moved to the drivers side of the decedents vehicle. All three officers pinned the decedent to the hood of the patrol car. The decedent was hunched over at the waist face down. They were attempting to grab his arms to cuff them. The decedent then pushed away from the patrol vehicle and stood straight up knocking the three officers off of him. 

Officers Ferrell, Zeller and Vogelpohl quickly grabbed the decedent again from behind. Officer Vogelpohl was on the decedents left hand side holding on to his left arm and he stuck his right leg out in front of the decedents leg and shoved him forward to take him to the ground. 

The decedent fell forward to the ground taking all of the officers to the ground. Officer Vogelpohl landed on the left side of the decedents upper torso and the other officers landed on top of the decedent as well. The decedent continued to struggle, throwing his arms around and screaming at officers. 

Officer Vogelpohl grabbed the decedents left arm with both his hands and attempted to pull it to the center of his back to cuff him. Once the decedent was cuffed the Houston Fire Department (HFD) brought a stretcher over and the decedent was placed on it. The decedent continued thrashing and screaming as he was being strapped down by HFD. HFD tried to talk to the decedent but he would not answer any questions. 

The decedent did not resist to a bandage being placed on his forehead from approximately a one half inch cut on his forehead. A C-collar was also placed on the decedent and then he was moved to the back board and onto a stretcher. He was still handcuffed behind his back with two pair of handcuffs because he was a large man. The EMTs requested that the officers not handcuff him behind his back. At that time, one officer handcuffed the decedents left hand to the railing of the stretcher and the right hand above his head to the backboard. This handcuff positioning was done at the request of HFD due to respiratory issues. 

The decedent did not struggle during this time. He was then loaded into the back of the ambulance and transported because of the scrape on his right elbow and the abrasion and cut to his forehead; he had been in an accident and he seemed disorientated. Inside the ambulance, HFD asked that one officer ride with them. 

While still on scene, the decedent then screamed for water. Water, Water, water!!! over and over. 

HFD told him they could not give him any water. He then started yelling my left wrist, my left wrist, it hurts, it hurts. The cuffs looked like they were twisted so he was uncuffed, his wrists repositioned and then recuffed. Officers observations were that the decedent was on PCP. 

HFD asked the basic protocol questions to the decedent and he did not answer any of the questions. They asked him if he had been taking anything, any drugs, or if he had been drinking. He would not answer. Paramedic Sucheki tried to put oxygen on the decedent and every time he put the mask on his face the decedent would pull it away. Sucheki tried at least three or four times. Sucheki also tried to check the decedents pupils but he would not open his eyes. When they got close to the hospital the decedents eyes were wide open and he was staring at Sucheki. 

Sucheki asked him if he was feeling better. He did not answer. At this point he was grabbing his bandages with his right arm. Sucheki was trying to calm him but he did not listen. He pulled off the piece of head tape that was used to secure his head to the backboard and tried to pull the C-Collar off but was unsuccessful. The decedents legs were off the gurney. They had been strapped down but he pulled his legs out from the strap and was now working his way off the stretcher. The ambulance was stopped and the officer called for back up. 

The decedent started to swing his legs towards paramedic Sucheki. They stopped at 288 South at North Macgregor. Patrol officers responded to the assist call and an officer came in and opened the back doors. The officers yelled at the officer in the back to tase him. At that time, the decedent was kicking radios and computer glass making it very dangerous; an officer then tased him. The decedent became very loud and was mother fucking the officers. The back of his head and shoulders were by the metal railing and his lower back was by the other railing. The railing was running across the lumbar part of his back as he was thrashing around. His head kept hitting the metal guard on the gurney and his back kept hitting the metal bar. 

Numerous officers went into the ambulance and secured his legs to the stretcher with tape and a bed sheet. Two officers remained in the ambulance in order to get him to the hospital. Once they arrived at the hospital, the staff asked that the restraints be removed so they could place their own on the decedent and he was moved to a bed. 

At that time, the pulse-ox machine which measures the amount of oxygen in blood was hooked up to the decedent and it read 100%, which is the best a person can get. 

Within two minutes he crashed and they began CPR. One round of drugs was administered, he was shocked once, and after three or four minutes he got pulses back but he was still breathing with a bag. 

An I.V. was placed in his femoral artery and he was examined from head to toe. Photos of the ambulance scene were taken and the image of the decedent on the gurney was captured. On April 22, 2011, at approximately 10:47 a.m., Dr. Fahn of Ben Taub Hospital pronounced the decedent dead. 

On April 23, 2011, Assistant Medical Examiner (ME) Dr. Morna Gonsulin performed the autopsy. The decedent tested positive for PCP and he had an enlarged heart. Notes were made of the blunt force trauma to the upper back area and evidence of deep muscular hemorrhage to the decedents neck and upper back that possibly disrupted an adequate supply of blood to the brain. 

The ME saw muscular hemorrhage to his buttocks which could have contributed to renal failure. Dr. Gonsulin viewed the photos taken by paramedics and concluded that the position that the decedent was in on the stretcher was consistent with the areas of injury. Over twenty (20) statements were taken from officers and paramedics. The official cause of death is still pending. Dr. Gonsulin did find hemorrhaging to the decedents brain and said it was not from blunt force trauma but seemed to be from a stroke.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/b91af76d713a40d0bd4b82f1426adb76.jpg,"49,73,439,536"

Investigators were assigned to conduct an investigation, however, it was learned that the suspect was not dead, but in critical condition. 

The following summary of this incident is based on the statements of the police officers, paramedics, and civilian witness. On May 29, 2010, Joseph Ramage (the decedent) was with Sandra Cameron at her residence, 11000 Kinghurst #167. The decedent told Cameron that he had to do some errands and that he would return later to take her to her appointment with her attorney. Cameron stated that at about 1100 hours, she saw the decedent acting strangely in the 11000 block of Kinghurst, yelling that someone was trying to kill him. Cameron stated that the decedent was trying to open the doors of several cars parked along the street and yelling, they're trying to shoot me, dont you see them? 

Cameron stated that the decedent attempted to open the door to an 18 wheeler parked on the street and she stopped him and tried to calm him down by talking with him. Cameron stated that she locked the door to the 18 wheeler so the decedent could not get inside it. 

Cameron stated that she tried to talk the decedent into coming inside her apartment, but he refused and continued to run up and down the street yelling that someone was trying to shoot him. Another resident at 11000 Kinghurst, Aminata Jarr, saw the decedents behavior and called 911. 

Jarr reported that the decedent was in the street yelling that someone was trying to shoot him and was seeing people that were not there. While Jarr was on the phone with the dispatcher, Cameron took the phone from her and attempted to cancel the call, but she did talk with the dispatcher, providing her with information. The dispatcher dropped a Welfare Check call. At 1217 hours, Officer L. Owens was dispatched to 11000 Kinghurst on a Welfare Check. 

When Officer Owens arrived, she said that she saw the decedent standing alone in the street next to an 18 wheeler. Officer Owens said that the decedent was bent over with his hands on his knees, breathing hard, sweating profusely, and yelling that someone was trying to shoot him. 

Officer Owens approached the decedent and tried to calm him down; however, he continued to yell that someone was trying to shoot him and asked her if she saw the person that was pointing the gun at him. Officer Owens stated that the decedent would not remain still and was pacing around. As she was trying to walk toward him, he would walk away, then suddenly stop and quickly walk toward her. Officer Owens stated that she tried talking with the decedent to calm him down, but he continued to act unpredictably.

Officer Owens requested assistance, code 1. About that time, the decedent began quickly walking away from her down Kinghurst Street when he suddenly tripped and fell to the street. At that time, Officer Owens approached the decedent and handcuffed him. At this point, Officer S. Wunderlich arrived to assist Officer Owens. The decedent was already handcuffed and was laying on his back in the street. Officer Wunderlick stated that the decedent was yelling help me, help me, he is going to shoot me. He is behind us, he is going to shoot. 

Officer Owens and Officer Wunderlich helped the decedent to his feet and walked him to Officer Owens patrol car. While walking to the patrol car, the decedent was uncooperative and attempted to pull away several times. When they arrived at the patrol car, the decedent leaned back and relaxed his legs, causing him to fall to the ground. The decedent is a very large man, 62 and approximately 300 pounds. Officer Wunderlich said that he attempted to hold him up, but was unable to, so he controlled the fall to the ground. 

At this point, the decedent is lying on his back in the street next to Officer Owens patrol car and his pants have fallen to his ankles. At that time, Officer L. Cantu arrived at the scene. Officer Wunderlich and Officer Cantu assisted in getting the decedent into the back seat of the patrol car. The decedent refused to follow the officers instructions and refused to stand on his own. The officers were eventually successful in getting the decedent into the patrol car. 

While getting him into the car, the decedent continued to yell that someone was trying to shoot him and his behavior would alternate from somewhat calm to very excited and combative. While the officers were placing the decedent into the car, he head butted Officer Wunderlich. The decedent sustained minor scrapes to his elbows and forehead when he fell to the ground, so Officer Owens requested an ambulance to come to the scene to check the decedent. While waiting for the ambulance, Officer Owens was seated in her car checking the decedent on the computer. The decedent was in the back seat, yelling, kicking his feet, and acting aggressively. He then began kicking at the car window, so the officers decided to restrain his legs to prevent him from hurting himself. Officer S. Bo and Officer H. Pham had arrived at the scene to help and they assisted Officer Cantu in applying leg restraints on the decedent. 

Officer Bo applied the restraints around the decedents ankles and looped the other end around the handcuffs, and the officers then turned him onto his side. At this point the ambulance arrived. The officers removed the decedent from the back of the patrol car and placed him on the street. The HFD EMTs, T. Reed and C. Rose both stated that the decedent was violently combative and making incomprehensible statements. The EMTs attempted to clean the decedents abrasions, but each time they tried to touch, him, he became more violent. 

The EMTs stated that they would transport the decedent to the hospital and the officers assisted them in placing the decedent onto the gurney. The decedent continued to struggle and yell while he was laced into the ambulance. The EMTs requested an officer to ride in the ambulance to the hospital and Officer Owens agreed to ride with them. 

While enroute to Ben Taub, the decedent continued his violent behavior, attempted to get off the stretcher, and was yelling. He continued this behavior until the ambulance was within about one block of the hospital, at which time he became very quiet, stopped breathing and became unresponsive, although he still had a pulse. The decedent was admitted to Ben Taub Hospital for treatment. The decedent died at Ben Taub Hospital on Sunday May 30, 2010.

He left with a co-worker whom he was giving a ride to mid-town. Bruckner said that he and the co-worker stayed in mid-town for about an hour. As he was leaving mid-town, he realized that he had left his mobile phone at work, so returned to Brixx Bar to collect it. He arrived at the bar, parked and approached the exterior gate. He opened the gate and entered the courtyard of the bar. Bruckner went to the front door of the business, opened it and went inside. As he entered the alarm sounded, so he turned to the alarm keypad right beside the front door to enter the code. The alarm going off confounded him, as it should not have gone off so soon upon entering. Just minutes prior to Bruckner arriving, an unknown white male (later identified as the decedent, Jonathan Lee Johnson) had made his way around to back of the Brixx Bar. He had pried loose a few boards from the northeast corner of the perimeter fence. He had made his way through the hole in the fence and around the back of the business. This path was through a 18-24 inch alley between the fence and the side, and then the back wall of the business. He then made his way into the back courtyard and approached one of the back doors of the bar. As Bruckner opened the front door, the decedent was breaking a hole into the glass back door. The two unknowingly entered the club virtually simultaneously. While Bruckner was at the keypad wondering why the alarm was going off he noticed movement out of the corner of his eye. He turned and saw the decedent at the bar. The decedent turned and ran out of the bar through the same door he had entered. Bruckner instinctively gave chase. Bruckner chased the decedent out of the bar, through the back of the courtyard, and down the slim alleyway. Bruckner had initially grabbed the decedents outer clothing at the entrance to the alley, and the two of them fell. The decedent was able to get back up and continue down the alley, with Bruckner in pursuit. At the southeast corner of the business, where
the decedent had made the hole in the fence, Bruckner again caught up to the decedent and the two fell again. This time Brucker was able to subdue the decedent and keep him on the ground. In the 18 inch alley, Bruckner kept the decedent pinned down as he called 911. The decedent had a mobile phone in his hand which Bruckner took away and used to call 911. He kept the decedent subdued by standing and keeping his weight on him. According to Bruckner, police arrived in less than five minutes. When the first unit arrived Bruckner flagged him down through the hole the decedent had created in the fence. When the subsequent police units reached the fence, Bruckner left the decedent and went to unlock the gate. He made his way back down the alley, retrieved his keys from inside the club, and made his way around the exterior of the businesses, as the back gate had to be unlocked from the outside. It was during this time that it became apparent to the officers that the decedent
was unresponsive. At first it was believed that the decedent was pretending to be injured in an attempt to fool the officers, but it was quickly determined that this was not the case. The officers at the scene called for an ambulance to check on the decedent, who had yet to be identified. While waiting on the Houston Fire Department (HFD), the officers attempted to pull the decedent from the alley. Officer Burke entered the gate after it had been opened by Bruckner and made his way down the alley to where the decedent was. The officers were able to pull him several feet closer to the hole in the fence, and were able to turn him slightly so they could see his hands. However, due to the mere 18 inches of space to operate in addition to the small hole in the fence, they were not able to get the decedent out of the alley, nor able to render aid to him. Before long, HFD arrived. At this point HFD took over and with the use of a power saw, cut a larger hole in the fence. They were then able to remove the decedent from the alleyway. The EMTs, with the use of their machines, were able to determine that the decedent was dead beyond resuscitation. The officers then called the Homicide
Division and secured the scene.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/e33e5b8e1298490487ec098ee73eb48b.jpg,"38,28,585,678"

Lopez and Officer K. Seitzinger of the Houston Police Department were dispatched to a report of a citizen holding a suspect at 10613 Dulcimer. 

Residents in the area of 10600 Dulcimer noticed the suspect, John Damon Revis, acting in an odd manner as he was running through yards, jumping fences, and running around several houses. The residents also heard the suspect claim that someone was after him, but none of them saw anyone after the suspect. The suspect approached the residence at 10613 Dulcimer, where he was met at the door by Mrs. Meretta Lucas, an 85-year old woman that lives there. 

Mrs. Lucas told the suspect to leave her property. When Mrs. Lucas turned her back, the suspect made entry into the residence, pushing past her husband, Mr. Charlesa Lucas, 90-year old man. The suspect then grabbed Mrs. Lucas by both arms. Noticing that the suspect had entered the residence and had grabbed Mrs. Lucas, Mr. Tommie Garrett, a neighbor from across the street, and two unidentified men went to the aid of the Lucas. 

The three men freed Mrs. Lucas from the grasp of the suspect and immediately removed him from the residence and held him on the ground until responding officers arrived. Upon arriving at the location, the officers observed the suspect lying on the ground outside of the residence as neighbors restrained him. 

Officers arrested the suspect and noticed that he was sweating profusely and appeared to be intoxicated on some unknown substance. Officers called for an ambulance to their location in
order to check on the Lucas as well as the suspect. Responding paramedics cleared the suspect and he was transported to the Houston City Jail by the officers. 

Upon arriving at the jail, it was determined that suspects condition had worsened. An ambulance was called to the jail and the suspect was transported to Ben Taub Hospital, where he was admitted. Officers filed the charge of Criminal Trespass against the suspect. On May 18, 2006, while being treated at Ben Taub Hospital, the suspect died. Hospital staff believed that the suspect died from multi-system organ failure.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/4d7fb41ca1c141ee9c7b752567edd2d9.jpg,"45,6,440,474"

Athmejvar, riding unit 3B14E, was on duty and patrolling near the 4700 block of N. Shepherd. 

While driving Athmejvar was flagged down by unknown citizens who told him that a man (later identified as the decedent, Joe Toby Mata) was standing in the street blocking traffic. 

Officer Athmejvar went to investigate and saw the decedent standing on the center median of the 4700 block of N. Shepherd. This stretch of N. Shepherd is a busy six lane roadway with a narrow, raised concrete median separating the north and south bound lanes. The decedent was stepping in and out of the moving lanes of traffic and posed a danger to himself as well as to passing motorists. 

Officer Athmejvar stopped his patrol car, turned on his overhead lights to warn passing motorists and approached the decedent, asking him what he was doing. The decedent was sweating profusely and appeared to be in an altered mental state as he failed to acknowledge Athmejvar's presence and continued to step in and then out of the roadway. 

Seeing that the decedent was continuing to be a danger to himself Officer Athmejvar went to handcuff him. As he did so the decedent pulled away and tried to walk into the northbound lanes of traffic. The decedent also began to grunt and make noises. Thinking that the decedent may be on a drug like P. C. P., Officer Athmejvar requested that additional units come to his location to assist him. 

Officer Athmejvar again went to handcuff the decedent as HFD fire truck E67 stopped and assisted Officer Athmejvar with handcuffing and placing him in the back seat of his police car. Officer Athmejvar then pulled onto a side street off of N. Shepherd to continue his investigation. Shortly after Officer Athmejvar pulled off of N. Shepherd additional officers began arriving. As they arrived the decedent began banging his head against the windows of Athmejvar's patrol car. Thinking that he may hurt himself, Athmejvar requested that a unit with leg restraints come to his location along with a supervisor. 

Sgt. Balderaz, riding unit 3B03T, arrived with the restraints and the decedent was placed in them and then laid on his side so that HFD medical personnel could evaluate him. They determined that the decedent required further medical treatment and that he would be transported to Northwest Memorial Hermann Hospital. He was loaded into ambulance S031A and transported to the hospital. Officer Athmejvar and Sgt. Balderaz followed the decedent to the hospital and then left once he had been secured by the hospital staff.

At approximately 7:47 p.m. September 11, 2010, the decedent died while being treated at Northwest Memorial Hermann Hospital. The initial medical investigation showed that his urine tested positive for the presence of cocaine and that enzymes were present in his blood that are commonly associated with the precursor to a myocardial infarction. Additionally, the decedent was in some stage of renal failure at the time of his death.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/2fffd9bd013e423dbbd9f5be82c32ecb.jpg,"64,19,423,444"

According to witness accounts, he was running in the roadway hitting the hoods and windows of passing vehicles. A Metro bus pulled up to the intersection to let passengers off at a bus stop, and the decedent chased a female passenger when she exited the bus. The decedent continued to run in the street and laid down in front of that Metro bus. Two witnesses, a male and female, drove by on South Wayside in their personal vehicle, and were  confronted by the decedent. He slapped the hood of their vehicle and stood in front of them. Unsure of his intentions, as soon as they could they raced past him. At a safe distance, they turned around and called 911, requesting both police and an ambulance and observed more of his behavior. The male witness stated the decedent continued to run around the intersection and watched as the decedent jumped up in the air and dove headfirst into the pavement. The male witness stated the decedent flopped around on the ground in a motion he described as like a fish. The male witness also described the actions of the decedent on the ground as like a child having a tantrum, striking the ground with his arms and legs. The male witness said that after several
minutes after calling 911, HPD officers began to arrive on scene. At approximately 10:11 p.m., the first Houston Police officer arrived at the scene at 3230 Telephone Road. At this point the decedent was lying in the street on the south side of South Wayside rolling around. The officer positioned his vehicle to protect the decedent from any oncoming traffic and stood by him attempting to speak with him. More officers arrived and the attempt to communicate with the decedent continued. The decedent
continued to roll around on the roadway and then he rolled into a used car lot parking area. Here the decedent continued to roll back and forth violently flailing his arms and striking the pavement.
When sufficient officers arrived, they approached the decedent to restrain and handcuff him. When the officers held his hands and feet the man stopped fighting and tensed up. The officers were able to quickly handcuff him without incident. When they rolled him over and sat him up, they noticed that he had stopped breathing. HFD was already on the scene and immediately came over and had officers remove the cuffs. With the assistance of police personnel they placed the decedent onto their stretcher. HFD started CPR on the decedent as they loaded him into the ambulance. HFD transported the decedent to Ben Taub hospital arriving at approximately 11:13 p.m. Ben Taub hospital continued to work on the decedent until he was pronounced dead at approximately 11:19 p.m.
NO OFFICERS FIRED THEIR WEAPONS OR TASERS DURING THIS INCIDENT. The decedent's injuries consisted of scrapes and cuts on his knees and elbows, most likely sustained from rolling on the pavement. He was also covered in dirt and mud from rolling around on the ground. Dr. Mark Escott was the physician who pronounced the decedent and he noted that his body temperature was 105.5

Olvera were dispatched to 526 Donnacorey to check by with Officer C. Barrera. Information in the call slip indicated that a male (the decedent) at the location had taken an intentional overdose of an unspecified substance. 

The decedent was later identified as Joe Faltesek. Officers Hightower and Olvera arrived to find members of the Houston Fire Department (HFD) as well as the decedents parents in the front yard of the residence. The decedents mother, who was later identified as Hazel
Faltesek, told Officer Olvera that the decedent was combative, had mental problems and that he had taken an assortment of drugs. Ms. Faltesek told Officers Olvera and Hightower that the decedent was inside the residence and gave them permission to enter and make contact. 

As Officers Olvera and Hightower entered the residence they encountered the decedent walking toward the front door. Officer Olvera observed the decedent to be agitated as he approached them with a noticeable bruise on his forehead along with blood on his nose and hands. Officers Olvera and Hightower backed out of the house into the driveway and the decedent continued to approach them. 

Without warning, the  decedent lunged at Officer Olvera and struck him in the face with a closed right hand. Officer Hightower attempted to tackle the decedent but fell awkwardly with the decedent landing on top of him.

Officer Olvera tried to assist and grab the decedent but he became more violent. Officer Olvera instructed Officer Hightower to release the decedent as he deployed his Conducted Energy Device (C.E.D.) and gave him verbal commands to surrender. After the decedent ingnored his commands, Officer Olvera discharged his C.E.D. and achieved successful dart strikes in the decedents torso and leg. 

As the C.E.D. cycled the first time, the decedent fell to the ground. The decedent continued to ignore Officer Olveras commands and made repeated attempts to get up from the ground and continue fighting. Officer Hightower notified the dispatcher of the need for more units to assist in
gaining control of the decedent. 

Officer Olvera continued to give the decedent commands to stay on the ground and cycled his C.E.D. several more times while waiting for additional manpower.

Additional units arrived on scene and attempted to place handcuffs on the decedent. The decedent continued to struggle and make attempts to get up from the ground. Officer Olvera removed his C.E.D. cartridge and delivered two drive stuns to the decedents upper back before they were able to secure the decedents hands behind his back. HFD Medics placed the decedent in the back of their ambulance with the intention of transporting him to Ben Taub Hospital; however, he went into cardiac arrest before they could leave the scene. 

HFD diverted to East Houston Medical Center with CPR in progress. Personnel at the hospital were unsuccessful at reviving the decedent and he was  pronounced dead at 4:30 p.m.",ed,,2,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/7c55912b92fd49a1b32e2e0b37fa3f2e.jpg,"15,3,563,653"

An officer was dispatched to the scene at 12303 Bellaire Boulevard and on arrival saw two suspects still holding the decedent face down on the ground. 

One suspect, the owner of the vehicle, reported to the officer that the decedent had tried to steal his vehicle. The officer handcuffed the decedent behind his back. The officer then attempted to sit the decedent up and observed that he had a fixed stare.

Lewis, was inside his residence at 14514 Chadbourne in emotional and psychological distress involving self-mutilation. 

The suspect's girlfriend, the homeowner, Claire Mathews, was inside the residence hiding in a closet. Mathews' mother, Debra Houston, who was outside the residence, heard the suspect breaking mirrors and furniture. 

Houston called 911 for assistance. The call originally dropped as a code two assault, but was subsequently changed to a Suicide/CIT. HFD Ambulance #83 arrived on scene with two Firefighters aboard, accompanied by HIFD Engine #78 with four Firefighters aboard. Officer R. W. Odums and Officer C. A. Frazho arrived soon after. The officers were advised by Ms. Houston that the suspect was inside the residence, naked, covered in blood, and breaking glass. Additionally, Ms. Houston informed the officers that she could not locate her daughter, Ms. Mathews. 

Officer Odums then had other units check by, along with a supervisor. Sergeant D. W. Rice arrived on the scene, as well as Officer E. A. Delgado. Sgt. Rice, Officer Odums, Officer Frazho, and Officer Delgado approached the front door and called out for the suspect. 

Lewis could be heard moaning, cursing, and screaming from the front bedroom area of the residence. Sergeant Rice decided to check on the welfare of the individuals inside. The officers entered the residence and located Lewis in the downstairs front bedroom. The suspect was lying on the bed, without any clothing, and covered in blood. Shards of broken glass were visible on his body and over the bedroom. 

Officer L. F. Sierra and Officer M. E. Ilag arrived on the scene and enter the premises. Sergeant Rice instructed Officer Ilag and Officer Frazho to search for the homeowner. Mathews was located in an upstairs closet. She informed the officers that the suspect had been acting crazy and freaking out_ since 5:00 a.m. before escalating into self-mutilation later that day. 

The suspect continued to yell and scream while striking himself with a closed fist. Due to the potentiality of a bio-hazard, Sergeant Rice discussed with Houston Fire Department personnel a plan of action to secure the suspect. The firefighters were able to wrap Lewis up in a blanket and move him to the floor area of the bedroom. The suspect continued to strike himself with his fist. 

Because of the agitated and combative state of the suspect, it was decided to handcuff the suspect in an effort to treat him. Officer Frazho handcuffed the suspect utilizing two pairs of handcuffs, linked together, behind his back. The suspect continued to strike his forehead against the floor repeatedly while thrashing about. 

At this point, the Fire Department personnel attempted to treat the suspect. After a few more moments of struggling, Lewis became still and stopped breathing. Officer Sierra noticed the suspect's eyes rolled back and told the paramedics it appeared he was not breathing. Officer Frazho then immediately removed the handcuffs. The paramedics began CPR and obtained a faint pulse before placing the suspect in an ambulance and transporting him to Memorial Hermann Hospital at Memorial City. After arrival, the suspect was pronounced dead at 5:48 p.m. by Dr. R. Owens in the Emergency Room. 

Mathews reported that she and Lewis had been drinking vodka and Hennesy cognac and smoking Kush synthetic marihuana the night before. She said that she fell asleep around midnight and doesn't know what Lewis may have consumed after that. She said that he did like to use cocaine. 

Lewis has a criminal history which includes arrests for Possession of Marihuana, Riding a Bike Under the Influence (California), Driving While Intoxicated, Driving While Intoxicated 2nd Offense, Possession of a Prohibited Weapon, and Assault Bodily Injury-Family Member. The autopsy was conducted on April 17, 2014, by Dr. Doyle at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Science. Although a final determination of death is unavailable at this time, Dr. Doyle did not find any signs of major trauma to the body. 

The case is being  investigated as a death in custody by the Houston Police Homicide Division and Internal Affairs Division and will be referred to the Harris County District Attorney_s office for review upon completion of the investigation.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/c480b8165d31475ab3926d2eb9d2fb3b.jpg,"41,0,399,424"

Flory (W/M DOB:7-3-83), walked into the Chevron at 9505 Clay Rd. 

According to the witnesses, the decedent walked behind the counter where attendant Shamsudin Shariff was working. He told the decedent to get back from behind the counter. The decedent said he was looking for his children even though he was alone. 

The attendant called the police when the decedent again went behind the counter. Another clerk thought it might be a robbery but no demands for money were made. It became apparent that the decedent was delusional and under the influence of narcotics.

 When the responding officer arrived, HPD Officer S. Pham tried to explain to the decedent that he had to leave the store at the request of the attendant. The decedent refused to leave without his children and became more aggressive as Officer Pham tried to walk him out of the store. 

When they got to the door, the decedent stopped and stiffened his body refusing Officer Phams orders to leave. Officer Pham attempted to handcuff the decedent who fought with Officer Pham and both attendants who were attempting to assist officer Pham. Officer Pham and both attendants fell to the floor in the struggle to subdue the violent decedent. Officer Pham was able to call for assistance on his radio as the decedent continued his violence. Although finally handcuffed, the decedent continued his violence by kicking at officers and the door to prevent being taken
outside of the store. Once outside, the decedent continued resisting and fighting with officers causing himself and the officers to fall in the parking lot. For the safety of all involved, leg restraints were applied to the decedent in an attempt to prevent further injury to the officers and the decedent. 

While placing the decedent in a patrol car, he continued violently thrashing and tried to bite the officers. He continued his thrashing while shouting obscenities at the officers. 

HFD was contacted at that point to check the welfare of the decedent due to his violent drug induced state. The decedent was able to free himself from the leg restraints and began violently kicking inside the patrol car. 

Officers removed him from the backseat to reapply the leg restraints as HFD paramedics arrived on scene. As paramedics attempted to check his blood pressure and heart rate, the decedent continued struggling against the handcuffs and leg restraints in an attempt to bite paramedics. 

After checking the decedent, he was again placed in the backseat of the patrol car. HPD officers transported the decedent to jail advising them that he was violent. During transport, the decedent continued thrashing about while continually talking to himself. He refused to cooperate with officers when asked for his booking information. 

While at the jail and before being booked, the decedent was checked by the jail doctor, Dr. Sapupelli, who refused the decedent and sent the officers to Ben Taub hospital with him. 

While in transport to Ben Taub hospital, the decedent was no longer shouting and appeared to be snoring.

Once they arrived at Ben Taub, the decedent was no longer combative and was admitted to the hospital. The attending nurse asked that the handcuffs be removed as they were cutting off the circulation as a result of the decedents violent behavior. Officers noted that due to the decedents aggressive state they were unable to check the handcuffs. 

Once the handcuffs were removed, officers observed the decedents wrists and ankles to be cut and bruised as a result of his violent flailing. The decedent also sustained scrapes to his elbows and knees that were consistent with the accounts of the violent encounter between the decedent, the officers and attendants. The decedent was admitted to Ben Taub hospital with a 107 degree temperature and a toxic level of cocaine. 

The decedent remained at Ben Taub hospital in a comatose state. On September 18, 2008, the medical staff
at Ben Taub met with the decedents mother, Tina Crone, and wife, Melissa Hopkins, who agreed not to
resuscitate after life-support ended. The decedent was pronounced deceased by Dr. Reddy on Sunday, September 21, 2008 at 5:20 am. Notification to the family was made by HPD Sergeant Jon Brooks.

Elizondos hand was bleeding and he left blood on the windows and concrete around the southern side of the station. Elizondo was heard incoherently and cursing. Witness Wilson did not unlock the door and called 911. 

Wilson continued to watch as Elizondo threw himself on the ground, threw trash lids, kicked over trash cans, and broke a squeegee. Wilson said that Elizondo ran into the median of Lathrop.

Sanders yelled at Elizondo to get off the car but he would not. Sanders could hear Elizondo screaming, They are going to kill me. She began moving forward at about 5 miles per hour and Elizondo let go of the mirror. 

To get away from Elizondo, Sanders turned west on the service road and made a u-turn at the next intersection. As she got back to Lathrop, she could see under the overpass that Elizondo was rolling around in the middle of the intersection of the north side of the East Freeway service road and Lathrop. She saw a patrol car pull up and shine a spot light at Elizondo. 

Elizondo got up and ran at the patrol car. Sanders turned right on Lathrop to take her daughter to work. She cleaned the blood up with baby wipes. As she was driving home she saw the police scene and stopped to cooperate with the investigation. Officer Nance was the first unit to arrive. Elizondo got up and ran at his car and climbed on the hood. 

He had the door cracked and yelled to Elizondo to calm down. Officer Nance saw that Elizondo was extremely intoxicated on drugs and decided to wait for back up before exiting to approach Elizondo. 

Officer Mendez was the second to arrive. He got out of his patrol car and Elizondo ran at him. Officer Nance got out of his patrol car and both walked towards Elizondo who was now on his back on the hood of Officer Mendezs patrol car. They tried to communicate with him but Elizondo was too incoherent. 

Officers Nance and Mendez decided to handcuff Elizondo. Each officer took a pair of handcuffs and placed them on a wrist. Elizondo began struggling and screaming, You are trying to kill me. The officers were able to slide Elizondo to the ground and hold him down with difficulty. Elizondo used his legs to start tangling up with Officer Nance. 

The officers were able to pull the ends of the 2 sets of handcuffs together in front of Elizondo and connect them. Elizondo was on his side with his hands cuffed in front. He was pushing up from the ground and was kicking at the officers. Officer Kramer arrived and grabbed Elizondos legs to keep him from kicking at the officers. 

Officer Fletcher arrived. He could see that Officers Nance and Mendez were fatigued and he went to assist them. Officer Rhodes and Werling arrived at about the same time. Officer Rhodes brought his leg restraints and was able to wrap up Elizondos feet. He then realized that Elizondo was handcuffed in front and did not ever pull Elizondos legs backwards. Elizondo, who is still on his side, stopped struggling. The Officers checked Elizondos pulse and find none. They put Elizondo on his back. Officer Kramer, a trained Army Medic, retrieved a breathing device from his trunk and began chest compressions. The officers continued to do CPR until HFD Medic 27 arrived and took over. HFD was able to restore a faint pulse so they transported Elizondo to Hermann Hospital where he was in critical condition. 

On Tuesday, October 29, 2013, life support was discontinued and at 11:50 a.m., Elizondo was pronounced dead at Hermann Hospital by Dr. Caroline Ha. Statements from family state that Elizondo had a history of drug usage. He had been told to leave his fathers home earlier because of erratic behavior. 

Elizondo was later at a friends house drinking when he began acting strange. Police were called but Elizondo fled before officers arrived. Toxicology screening at the hospital showed cocaine and marijuana. Hector Elizondo shows the following criminal history: 8 open City of Houston traffic warrants. 1 open City of Pasadena municipal warrant.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/050cc08e96154e0c880a7e81326a465c.jpg,"8,25,555,675"

Elizondo, all checked-by with Officer Proske. Officer Proske was asked by Houston Fire Department Ambulance 77 personnel, who were already at the scene, to assist in controlling a Hispanic male patient (later identified as the decedent, Frank W. Hernandez) who needed to be transported to the hospital. 

The decedent was combative and apparently under the influence of an unknown substance. 

The decedent was flailing his arms, talking incoherently, and could not be controlled. Officer Proske placed the decedent in handcuffs and followed the ambulance to Memorial Hermann HospitalMemorial City. 

Approximately three minutes after arriving at the hospital, the decedent flat-lined but was revived. Officer Proske left the decedent in the care of the hospital and after calling Houston Homicide Division for guidance, completed an Investigation Homicide report. Officer Proske completed his shift and went home.

On Tuesday, September 28, 2010, at approximately 3:40 a.m., Sergeant R. Bridges, Houston Homicide
Division, was notified by Investigator Joyce Gigout, Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, that the decedent died while in the hospital at 2:06 a.m. Sergeant Bridges notified Houston Police Homicide Lieutenant H. D. Harris who assigned the case to investigators Sergeant Brian Harris and Officer M. F. Waters. Sergeant Harris and Officer Waters attended the autopsy on Tuesday morning, September 28, 2010. Via AFIS, the identity of the decedent was determined to be Frank W. Hernandez, DOB: 12/24/78.

Gessner.

As the units began to arrive in the area they saw a naked black male, later identified as Mr. Erick Lee, running in and out of traffic. The wife of Mr. Lee, Dana Lee, told officers that her husband had been smoking PCP prior to their arrival. Dana Lee told the officers that this was not the first time her husband had smoked PCP and acted in this manner and that he had an addiction to PCP. 

The responding officers made contact with Mr. Lee who was yelling and screaming at the top of his lungs and ran towards the officers with closed fists. Officer W. Rutherford deployed his Conducted Energy Device (CED) at Mr. Lee, striking him in the upper chest area and face. Mr. Lee continued to resist arrest/detention and it took several officers to handcuff Mr. Lee.

 In fact Officer Rutherford had to cycle his CED multiple times before the officers were able to gain control of Mr. Lee. The officers were finally able to use two sets of cuffs to control Mr. Lee in addition to leg restraints. HFD ambulance #68 arrived on the scene and transported Mr. Lee to Memorial Hermann Southwest Hospital. 

Shortly after his arrival at the hospital, Mr. Lee went into unconsciousness. The officers removed the handcuffs and leg restraints that were used to control Mr. Lee allowing the hospital staff to provide medical attention to Mr. Lee. The hospital staff quickly brought Mr. Lee back around and he was later admitted to the hospital. On Friday, September 27, 2013, the Homicide hold desk was notified that Mr. Erick Lee had died at Memorial Hermann Southwest.

 The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences was notified and issued ML# 13-3152 for this event and performed an autopsy on Saturday, September 28, 2013. The results are still pending.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/305b5402895449a7bb93b7e04b049efc.jpg,"0,28,585,722"

A security guard had attempted to reason with the decedent to no avail and he ran from the motel grounds onto the North Freeway Service Road (S/B) and then onto the southbound lanes of the North Freeway before they lost sight of him. 

Officer G.Welch was the first officer to arrive in the area and stated that he observed a man he later came to know as the decedent running on the exit ramp in the 4100 block of the North Freeway. He requested that other arriving units set up a perimeter as he observed the decedent begin running across the southbound lanes of the North Freeway. Officer Welch eventually located the decedent running in the northbound lanes of the North Freeway. 

Officer Welch pulled over and spoke to him momentarily when he jumped into the HOV lane. The decedent disregarded Officer Welchs commands and ran from the HOV lane into the southbound freeway lanes. With other officers blocking traffic, Officer Welch eventually took the decedent to the ground where a struggle ensued. 

Officers J. Corless and Welch could not gain control of the decedent. Officer Welch told Officer Corless to use his Conducted Energy Device to drive stun the decedent, which he did twice. They were able to handcuff the decedent and remove him from the freeway in a patrol car to the parking lot of the Texan Inn where Officer Welch called for the ambulance to return to the scene. Officer Welch contacted the Harris County District Attorneys Office and was advised to file Evading Arrest on the decent. 

After calling for an ambulance a second time without success, Officer Welch decided to transport the decedent to jail where he could be examined by jail medical personnel. 

Up to this time the decedent had not exhibited any sign of medical distress, but was continuously cursing and yelling at the officers. When Officer Welch, along with Officer Rodriguez following, arrived at the jail they met with Sergeant G. Cowger and medical staff member Windle and told them the decedent had been drive stunned with a Conducted Energy Device. 

Windle advised the officers that that if the decedent could or would not enter the jail on his own they would refuse to take custody of him. The decedent did not comply with the officers commands, was refused entry to the jail. 

Officer Welch then drove the decedent to Ben Taub Hospital at 11:31 p.m. When he arrived at 11:38 p.m., he found the decedent unresponsive and immediately summoned medical personnel. After they took custody of the decedent, Officer Welch contacted the Homicide Division and advised desk personnel of the decedents condition.

 He then called the District Attorneys office again and told them of the decedents condition. They agreed to decline the charge. While speaking by phone to his supervisor (Sergeant J. W. Nickell), Officer Welch learned that the hospital medical team had successfully revived the decedent and he passed this information on to Homicide. 

The decedents condition later deteriorated and he was pronounced dead at 7:52 a.m. on September 1, 2012. Social Work Case Manager Denyse Thierry contacted the Command Center, who in turn contacted the Homicide Division to begin this investigation. The attending physician, Dr. G. Dronavalli, noted that the decedents drug screen, performed upon his arrival to Ben Taub Hospital, returned positive for cocaine. An autopsy was performed on September 2, 2012, at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. The results are pending.",ed,,,,,

Jackson. The neighbors began calling each other with reports on where the thief was and what he was driving. 

Kevin Jackson discovered that three bicycles had been stolen from his side yard. He also found that the expanded metal, some angle iron, and a steel air conditioner cage he had made were also stolen from his shop.

Jackson began looking around and located a brown van that had been reported as the possible vehicle used in the thefts. Jackson saw the decedent come out of a vacant house and load up some items. Jackson could not see what the items were because of the positioning of the van and the location from which he was observing the decedent. 

The decedent drove to 2820 Holmes road, Holmes Road Recycling, to sell the metal items. He pulled into the back and his van was being weighed in before unloading the steel. Jackson went into the office and reported that the items the decedent had were stolen. Brian Henke, an employee of Holmes Road Recycling, heard the report of a thief on the yard over the company radio system. 

Henke went to the pay out window because there is often a disturbance when they refuse to pay. Jackson went outside to wait. The decedent pulled out of the recycling area in his van. Jackson went over to confront the decedent about the theft. The decedent denied stealing the metal. The decedent got into his van to leave. 

Jackson then used a jack handle he had to break the driver door window out of the van. Jackson told the decedent to give him the money for the stolen items. Jackson then took the keys from the decedent and he came out of the van. Jackson, still wanting the money for the stolen items, broke more windows out of the van. 

Henke heard a window break and saw Jackson breaking more windows. Henke went over toward the van and said the police were coming. He told Jackson to go wait in his truck. The decedent, upon hearing police were enroute, turned and ran east on Holmes Road. Jackson drove after the decedent in his truck. 

Jackson cut in front of the decedent several times striking him with the front passenger quarter panel of the truck at least one time. The decedent continued to run east on Holmes until he got to State Highway 288. He ran up under the overpass. 

Jackson turned onto the service road for 288 and lost sight of him. Henke was picked up by a passing car. He was driven to the decedent who was now on the other side of 288 on Holmes Road. 

Henke was notifying the 911 operator of the updated locations. Henke got out on foot and was behind the decedent when he turned south on Canyon road. Henke pushed the decedent so that he fell into a street side drainage ditch. Henke told him to stay in the ditch because police were coming. The decedent was acting very strangely. 

He was squatting down and hopping like a frog trying to get out of the ditch; sliding back after every attempt. Patrol units, Officers Walker, Watson and Jackson, arrived on the scene while the decedent was still in the ditch. The officers observed the decedent leaning back on the bank of the ditch with his hands behind his head and breathing hard. 

Officers approached the decedent, told him to roll over and place his hands behind his back. The decedent rolled over but did not put his hands behind his back. Officers said he did not resist when being handcuffed. After being searched, Officer Jackson monitored the decedent. 

He stated the decedent was still breathing very hard, was not sweating and had a blank stare on his face. Officer Jackson requested an ambulance to the location to check on the decedent. The ambulance arrived and began evaluating the decedent. They requested the handcuffs be removed so they could treat him. Officer Jackson removed the handcuffs. While being treated by Houston Fire Department EMTs, the decedent coded. HFD was able to resuscitate him. 

He was transported to Ben Taub Hospital where he died. An autopsy was performed the next day at the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. No signs of trauma were found.

The decedent was described as wearing only gray boxer shorts, with white socks and no shirt. Police officers arrived on the scene at approximately 5:31 pm, which was in the 12200 block of Wallisville Road in Houston, Harris County, Texas. 

Upon arrival, officers saw that Houston Fire Department paramedics were already on the scene and they had the decedent restrained with tape so they could provide medical attention. The decedent continued to resist the Fire Department personnel, so officers began to assist in restraining him. The decedent grabbed the hand of one of the police officers and bent the officers fingers back and he began to kick at the paramedics. Police officers handcuffed the decedent in an attempt to restrain him, so medical attention could be administered.

Soon after being handcuffed, the decedent became unresponsive; so officers un-handcuffed him and removed the tape that paramedics had used to restrain him. 

Paramedics immediately began to treat the decedent using an automated external defibrillator. After a pulse was found, the decedent was transported to Houston Medical Center located at 1311 East Freeway. The decedent was later moved to Pasadena Bayshore Hospital; however, he never regained consciousness.

W. Chappell and Sgt. T. Hanslik, were contacted by Officer M. Brady regarding the death of decedent, Charles Albert Cathey, III, who was in police custody. We both responded to Ben Taub Hospital and were directed to the 6th floor. 

We found the decedent in room #6F04. Officer C. L. Bruce was sitting outside the room. The investigation revealed that Officer R. S. Kuski had been dispatched to an assault in progress on Saturday January 15, 2011, at 4000 W. 34th #82 at approximately 9:39 p.m. 

Several other units checked by with him. Officer Palla was the first to arrive and was directed by a civilian witness, Mr. Juaquin Ayala, to the decedent. Officer Palla detained the decedent by placing handcuffs on him. Mr. Ayala reported that the decedent had broken into his apartment and stolen $5 and his car keys from a table just inside the front door. 

Mr. Ayala stated that the decedent then tried to run away and he grabbed him from behind in an effort to hold him until police arrived. The decedent was able to get away from Mr. Ayala, however. Mr. Ayala was able to keep the decedent in sight until he was arrested. Officer Palla escorted the decedent to his patrol car and was joined by Officer Ferrell. The decedent was placed in the back seat of a patrol car while officers conducted the scene investigation. During this time, Officer Kuski arrived on scene as well. He directed Officer Palla to speak with the witnesses in an effort to determine what had occurred. In the meantime, Officer Kuski began to check the decedent for warrants on his on board computer. 

During this time, the decedent began kicking the inside of the patrol car. He raised his legs and began kicking the ceiling and shouting erratically. His words were incoherent and rambling about God and that he was going to die. 

Officers on the scene believed that the decedent was combative to the point that he may injure himself or damage the interior of the patrol car. They decided to use leg restraints in an effort to control him. Officers Palla, Kuski, Ferrell and Pizana removed the decedent from the back seat and placed him in the interlocking device. 

The decedent continued to struggle with the officers forcing them to hold his arms and legs down until he was properly restrained. He was then placed in another patrol car on his side. The officers contacted Sgt. Allen Carr who made the scene. The decedent began shouting that he was going to kill himself and was still shouting other odd phrases that made no sense. 

When Sgt. Carr arrived on scene, the decedent was still belligerent and shouting. Officer Kuski then transported the suspect to the NPC located at Ben Taub Hospital and Officer Pizana followed. Once at NPC, the doctor rejected the decedent and advised the officers to direct book him into the Harris County Jail. Officer Kuski took the decedent to the Harris County Jail located at 1201 Commerce with Officer Pizana following. 

Once at the jail, other deputies and jailers assisted with removing the leg restraints from the decedent. It was at this point that he became irrational. He began talking in the third person and was stating that he could not stand up while the deputies were attempting to fingerprint and photograph him. Two deputies held him up while he was printed and photographed. 

Officer Kuski was busy filling out the booking paperwork. When Officer Kuski looked over, he noticed that the decedent was not responding and appeared to be limp and slumped over. Sgt. Gore, with the Harris County Jail, then ordered one of the other jail attendants to call for medical assistance. Once the nurses arrived, they took his blood pressure and temperature. He had an elevated temperature over 101 degrees and a faint pulse. 

The deputies started CPR while waiting on an ambulance. HFD ambulance #09 arrived and took over CPR and transported the decedent to Ben Taub Hospital. Once at the hospital, he was placed on a ventilator and provided medical attention. On January 17, 2011, the decedent's family decided to cease the ventilator and he died as a result. Dr. Jarrouge pronounced the decedent dead at 3:08 p.m.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/7e11ec38b5ce49b5a44e96776dfabf93.jpg,"13,3,573,668"

Miller was dispatched to a citizen holding a suspect call at 5901 Selinsky Road, apartment 183. 

When she arrived at the location she found the reportee, Shanequa Minor restraining Branndon Jefferson. It was later learned that Jefferson, who Minor described as the father of her children, arrived at Minors apartment around 9:00 p.m. the previous night. She said that he came and went several times during the night. When he came back to stay, he told her that he had smoked some sherm, or a marijuana cigarette dipped in PCP. Minor said that he seemed agitated and she told him to try and relax. He told her that he had also taken a molly. 

Minor said that she got him glass of milk hoping it would help him relax. She said that despite his apparent condition, which was making her nervous, she lay down in her bed. She said that soon after she lay down, Jefferson yelled something unintelligible and started going crazy. He ran out of the room to the front door and was trying to get out. 

Minor said that she restrained him to keep him from running out. She said that he yelled dont let them touch me! She said that when he was unable to go out the front door, he ran straight into an exterior wall of the living room in what she thought was an attempt to escape the apartment. He ran into the wall with such force that he put a large hole in the sheetrock. 

Minor said that she went over to him trying to calm him down. She said that he pulled away from her and ran head first into another wall of the apartment, again putting a hole in the sheetrock. From there he went to the window of the second story unit and pushed against it in an apparent attempt to flee the apartment. The large multi-pane window bulged out, but did not break. She said that he ended up on floor, and she was over him trying to calm him down. She said that he got up and ran back into the bedroom. 

He ran into the rear exterior wall in another futile attempt to get out of the apartment. Again he struck the sheetrock with such force, he damaged the sheetrock. Minor said that Jefferson then went back into the living room and again tried to leave out the front door. Due to his condition, she said that she did not want to let him out. 

She told him that if he didnt calm down, she would have to call the police. He ended up on the floor of the apartment again, so she got on top of him to hold him down. He continued to struggle so she called 911. She told the call taker that Jefferson had admitted to taking drugs and was tearing up her apartment. She said that she stayed on top of Jefferson until the police arrived, but had to get off of him to answer the door. Jefferson was lying on the floor of the apartment on his back. When he saw Officer Miller, he became agitated, and Minor advised Officer Miller to wait at the door. 

Minor said that she would be able to restrain Jefferson and keep him calm until additional units could arrive. Minor straddled Jefferson who was still lying on his back on the floor of the apartment. Officer Miller waited at the front door where she could monitor the situation without further agitating Jefferson. She waited at the door for a short while until Sergeant J. A. Shilling arrived at the scene. Officer Miller advised Sergeant Shilling that Jefferson appeared to be on some type of narcotic and was agitated. Sergeant Shilling determined that at minimum Jefferson would need to be detained in order to obtain an Emergency Mental Health Warrant and/or to obtain medical help for him. When Jefferson saw Sergeant Shilling he again became agitated. 

Sergeant Shilling and Officer Miller were able to speak to Jefferson to keep him calm as they waited for additional back-up. Jefferson told them that he didnt want to go to jail, and they assured him that they were there to help him and that he would be going to the hospital and not to jail. They told Jefferson to roll onto his stomach and place his hands behind his back, but he refused to comply. Sergeant Shilling reached for and grabbed Jefferson left wrist in an attempt to gain compliance, but Jefferson pulled away. 

Jefferson was rambling incoherently and making comments of not wanting to go to jail. When Officers C. Bautista and R. Arriaga arrived, they engaged Mr. Jefferson in an attempt to get him restrained. He was still lying on his back and refusing to comply with the verbal commands he was receiving to lie on his stomach and place his hands behind his back. The officers had to turn Jefferson over onto his stomach. 

Jefferson tensed up and started yelling as he was rolled over. He started kicking his legs and once on his stomach attempted to get up by pushing up on the floor. The officers were able to hold him down and then he pulled his hands under his body, resisting their efforts.  With Officer Miller restraining Jeffersons legs, Sergeant Shilling and Officer Arriaga at his left arm and Officer Batista at his right arm they were able to successfully handcuff him behind his back. Once handcuffed, Sergeant Shilling requested Houston Fire Department paramedics to assess Jefferson. Due to his continuing combative demeanor, Sergeant Shilling determined that it would be too dangerous to try and remove Jefferson from the upstairs apartment simply handcuffed, so he asked for an interlocking device to restrain his legs. 

Officer Miller had one in her vehicle, so she went out to retrieve it. Jefferson continued to struggle with the officers, yelling the entire time. When Officer Miller returned with the interlocking device, and attempted to apply them, Jefferson stiffened his body to resist their efforts. With great difficulty, the restraint was placed onto Jeffersons legs and connected to the handcuffs. Sergeant Shilling had Jefferson immediately rolled onto his side and then checked for the proper distance of 12 inches from feet to hands using his flashlight - which he knew to be 13 inches in length. During the entire restraining process, Jefferson had been resisting all efforts and yelling at the officers. However, within seconds of being rolled onto his side, Jefferson went limp and became unresponsive. 

Officer Miller performed a sternal rub with her knuckles to which Jefferson did not respond. Unsure if Jefferson was in actual medical distress or faking unconsciousness, Sergeant Shilling had the officers remove the leg restraints, but left the hand cuffs in place. The officers quickly assessed Jefferson and it was determined that he was breathing and had a pulse. Sergeant Shilling advised dispatch of the situation and that paramedics were now needed urgently. Officer Arriaga performed a second, more aggressive sternal rub with the end of his flashlight, to which Jefferson still did not respond. The officers closely monitored Jeffersons condition and within minutes it deteriorated. When it appeared that he stopped breathing and lost his pulse, Sergeant Shilling had the handcuffs removed and they started chest compressions. Officers Miller, Arriaga, Batista and Gunter (who had arrived after Jefferson had lost vitals) all participated in the life saving effort. 

They each performed two rounds of chest compression, rotating so as not to tire out. They continued chest compressions until Houston Fire Department Ambulance 55 paramedics arrived and took over.  The Houston Fire Department paramedics worked on Jefferson for several minutes before loading him and transporting him to Ben Taub Hospital. At the hospital he was pronounced dead at 5:59 AM. 

At the time of this summary, an autopsy had not been performed, so the exact cause of death was not known. It is also not known when exactly Mr. Jefferson died, but he was officially pronounced dead by doctors at Ben Taub Hospital at the above listed time.",ed,,1,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/28601109ff4349d5951888795baeb7a5.jpg,"0,28,585,722"

Investigators learned the following: Police Officer A. Lopez riding unit 11H42E stopped to buy a bottle of water at a convenience store at 2709 Broadway when he saw a man crossing the street waving his arms and screaming at approximately 4:07 p.m. Officer Lopez went outside and saw that the man was bleeding from his mouth and head. Lopez told the man that he wanted to get help for him but the man stormed past Lopez and entered the shop at around 4:07 p.m. 

The man was acting erratically. Lopez and all the officers involved have had basic C.I.T. training and assessed that the man was not only in physical distress but mental distress as well. After Lopez offered to assist the man, he started to act  aggressively towards the officer telling the officer he was ""not going back to the jail."" 

The officer called for backup and requested HFD to come to the location. Additional officers arrived at the scene and they eventually put the man in handcuffs. Even though he was handcuffed, he continued to kick at officers. The officers described the man flailing around ""as if it were a fish out of water"".

The officers used leg restraints to control the kicking but kept him on his side so he could breathe. The officers said this was hard because he would flip and flop onto his stomach. The officers kept him on his side as much as possible and monitored his breathing. The man was ""kicking and moving"" even when attended to by the Houston Fire Department, ambulance #36. 

The surveillance camera at the gas station shows HFD arriving at approximately 4:21 p.m. The man suddenly became unresponsive, was loaded in the ambulance and was pronounced dead at St. Joseph Medical Center in downtown Houston. Dr. Anwar Rawat pronounced the male dead at 5:20 p.m. Even after struggling with the man, the officers were planning on taking him to Ben Taub to be psychologically evaluated as he was clearly mentally disturbed. 

As as result, the report will be labeled dead man as the investigation continues. The officers described the man as having incredible Herculean strength. His wrists were so large and his shoulders so wide that they had to use two sets of handcuffs. Dr. Gonsoulin from the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences performed the autopsy under M.L.#2581. She noted some minor hemorrhaging to his arms and legs and no significant injuries to his head. 

She noted that there were no external wounds or injuries that could have caused death. She said that the heart was large but he was a large man. She also noted that there was no brain damage. The doctor said she would wait for Toxicology and the final ruling could take 6 to 12 weeks. The complainant was identified as Billy Ray Davis with a date of birth of 04-05-1956. If this is the deceased, he has a county history of untreated Bi-polar, schizophrenia and Hypertension disorder (high blood pressure). 

At the time of this report, the identity has not been confirmed by the medical examiner's office. Four civilian witnesses all said the officers kept on telling the man they wanted to get him help not arrest him. Witnesses said that the officers involved never threw any kind of strikes or holds on the body or neck area. They noted the officers were concerned about keeping him on his side so he could breathe.

Lopez and M.A. Matus, riding unit 18G22I were dispatched to a Priority II Meet The Firefighter Urgent Call at 7615 Gulfton. Officers arrived at 2126 hours and were advised by HFD personnel that the ambulance crew was having problems with a patient that was highly intoxicated, laying on the ground, and combative. 

The officers approached the suspect and found him lying on the ground violently flailing his arms and legs. Witnesses told officers that the male had forced his way into apartment #59 before their arrival. Officers approached the suspect and attempted to handcuff him. 

The suspect resisted the officers by pushing and kicking the officers. Matus and Lopez attempted to calm the male but were unable to do so. The suspect continued to resist the officers. Officer Matus then deployed his taser striking the male suspect in the back. The taser deployment had little or no effect on the suspect. Officer Matus then deployed his taser for a second time and again attempted to handcuff the suspect to no avail. Matus deployed his taser a third time. 

He and Officer Lopez attempted to handcuff the suspect again but were still unable to gain control of him. Officer Matus then deployed his taser a fourth time. The two officers were then able to handcuff the suspect with the assistance of HFD personnel. The suspect was then placed onto an HFD gurney and rolled toward the ambulance. Once the suspect arrived at the ambulance he was found to have no vital signs. 

Officer Matus assisted HFD in administering CPR to the suspect while he was being loaded into the ambulance. The male was then transported to Memorial Southwest Hospital by HFD. The unknown male was pronounced dead at Memorial Southwest Hospital at approximately 2236 hours by Dr. Katherine Heley.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/59c784cc57c149c1a2ccf92530a46a77.jpg,"23,88,543,705"

Complainant entered the parking lot by forcing himself through a patched area in the chain-link fence. The complainant, who was obese, was sweating heavily and short of breath when he approached the officers. 

The complainant was ranting and raving that someone was trying to kill him and that the officers should draw their weapons to defend themselves. The officers then conducted a search of the premises and did not observe anyone to be following the complainant. In the meantime, the complainant had collapsed to the pavement. The officers then attempted to move the complainant over to their patrol car but he continued to collapse to the pavement. 

The officers decided that it would be easier to move the complainant if he were handcuffed. After handcuffing the complainant, the officers were able to get him up on his feet. Recognizing that the complainant needed medical attention, the officers contacted the dispatcher to have an ambulance sent to their location. 

Shortly thereafter, the complainant again collapsed to the pavement. Noticing the complainant to be in distress the officers removed the handcuffs. The officers again checked the complainant and discovered that he was not breathing and immediately began administering CPR.

Douglas was dispatched to a Suspicious Circumstances call at 318 South Lake, in the town of Holiday Lakes, Brazoria County, Texas.

RO was advised by Brazoria County Sheriff's Office (BCSO) Dispatch that the actor was yelling and beating the front door in an attempt to gain access to the home. RO was also informed the subject was a black male, wearing a black shirt and pants. Upon arrival at 318 S. Lake RO did not find anyone outside. RO then checked the residence across the street (317 S. Lake) with the same results.

RO then observed two white males at the corner of S. Lakes and Rocket Lane. They advised the actor was now across the street at 319 S. Lake. As RO drove into the driveway at that address, RO observed a black male matching the description given by BCSO Dispatch, beating on the front door of the home. RO advised BCSO Dispatch of the correct address. As RO was getting out of his patrol car, the actor quickly charged toward RO. Actor was yelling something that RO was not able to understand.

When the actor arrived at where RO was getting out of the patrol car (between the driver's side of the patrol car and the gate post of the chain link fence that surrounded the property) the Actor using his hands began hitting RO about the upper torso and arms. The actor using his feet was also kicking RO on his legs. At the same time the actor was striking RO's patrol car with his hands and feet.

BCSO ID Officer Goolsby and RO later observed a handprint that was possibly the actor's on the driver's side rear window of the patrol car. RO did not use any weapons during the attack because RO observed that the actor did not have anything in his hands. RO was attempting to calm the actor down by talking to him in what started as a calm normal voice, asking the actor what the problem was. During this time RO was knocked to the ground by the actor. RO then ordered the actor to get on the ground several times and RO was attempting to hold onto the actor. The actor did not comply with RO's commands and was attempting to run away. The actor broke away from RO momentarily and while standing in the road either pushed his shorts down or allowed them to fall down onto the road.

RO again attempted to grab the actor and detain him using hand hold techniques. AS RO continued to struggle with the Actor, the two subjects that had earlier directed RO to the location of actor came to assist RO. With their assistance RO was able to get the Actor down on the ground. The Actor continued to struggle with RO and the 2 citizens. At this point the Actor was on his hands and knees.

Eventually RO and citizens assisting him were able to control the actor enough for RO to place handcuffs on the actor. RO immediately rolled the actor from a face down position onto his right side. RO checked the actor and found him to be nonresponsive. RO checked for a pulse and was not able to find one. RO rolled the actor onto his back and checked again for a pulse. RO could not find a pulse and the actor appeared to not be breathing.

RO then advised BCSO Dispatch the actor was nonresponsive and to send EMS in. BCSO 1544 Greathouse with trainee Harwell and BCSO 1545 Houk arrived within 1 minute. Deputy Houk was also unable to find a pulse. Deputy Houk and Trainee Harwell began CPR on the actor approximately 1 minute later. Angleton EMS Unit 5412 arrived approximately 3 to 4 minutes later and took over chest compressions.

While CPR was being performed on the actor, 2 black males arrived on scene inquiring as to what happened to the actor. They were identified as Jessie Beverly and Kenric Dudley. Beverly advised he had known the actor since he was very young. He identified the actor as Jimmy Washington.

EMS personnel worked on reviving the actor for approximately 30 minutes on scene and then transported the actor to UTMB Angleton campus. The ER Physician, Dr. Julio Jayes, pronounced death at 0101 hours. At 0220 hours, RO accompanied ER Dr. Jayes and RN Stephanie Dejongh into the grievance room where the Actor's spouse, Ebony Nicole (Davis) Washington, B/F, DOB: 03/01/80 was waiting. Dr. Jayes informed Mrs. Washington of her husband's death. Mrs. Washington advised her husband's full name was Jimmy Lloyd Washington, Jr. and that his birth date was 06/04/72. Mrs. Washington stated that her husband, Jimmy Washington, would occasionally leave home for several days without contacting her. She further stated when he disappeared in this manner, it was her belief that he was using controlled substances. She also stated that she had not heard from him since the previous Thursday, July 2nd.

Mrs. Washington advised RO that her husband's usual controlled substance when he abused was crack cocaine. She went on to state that he usually came to Holiday Lakes when he disappeared and was abusing drugs. She advised she did not know who friends were in the Holiday Lakes area or where he acquired his drugs from that he abused. She also stated that her husband had been having headaches lately but would not go to a doctor concerning the headaches. JP 2-2 Richard B. Davis came to the ER and pronounced death at 0214 hours on 07/08/15. JP Davis also authorized a full and complete autopsy. 

RO received a public service call from BCSO Captain Chris Kincheloe at 0405 hours advising that District Attorney Jeri Yenne had requested an In-Custody Death Investigation. Capt. Kincheloe advised RO to not allow Carnes Funeral Home to transport the decedent until he and his team arrived and completed their process. RO advised Carnes of the delay and awaited Capt. Kincheloe's team to arrive.

RO completed the Brazoria County 3 page Death Investigation Report. Capt. Kincheloe's team did arrive, consisting of himself, Investigator Stephen Buchanan, and 2 ID officers, Lt. Mark Adams and Heather Goolsby. Numerous photos of the decedent and RO were taken. RO surrendered the decedent's shoes and sorts which the decedent had taken off at the original scene in Holiday Lakes. RO also surrendered the recording media from the patrol car video system. This was returned to RO later after ID Officer Nielsen copied the files on it. A DNA swab was taken of blood on RO's badge patch of RO's uniform shirt. RO later surrendered the uniform worn during the incident to Nielsen.

Over the course of the next 3 days RO obtained the medical records on the actor from UTMB Angleton Campus. RO also learned that no blood was drawn for lab testing and no other lab tests were ordered for the Actor at UTMB-Angleton Campus. These medical records and information were forwarded via email to Dr. N.C. Mambo of the Galveston County Medical Examiner's Officer as requested by him on July 13, 2015.

Response sent on March 21","At 10:52 a.m. on Friday, April 8, 2011 Grand Prairie P.D. 9-1-1 received a call from Mike Bice (469-426-7530) reporting a disturbance at 2803 Riverside Parkway at the Towns of Riverside apartments here in Grand Prairie, Tarrant County. Mr. Bice advised the 9-1-1 call taker there was a man (later identified as 34 year old Thanh Nguyen) running around in his boxers, yelling for help.

Grand Prairie Police Officers Olivere and Blessing were immediately dispatched to respond. While the officers were en route to that call, Mr. Bice told the call taker that Mr. Nguyen was on the back side of an apartment and appeared to be trying to break into an apartment. Mr. Bice said Mr. Nguyen was throwing an outdoor cooking grill into the rear patio glass door of an apartment, appearing as if he was trying to get inside of that apartment. Mr. Bice told the call taker that it looked to him as if Mr. Nguyen was on drugs and it looked as if Mr. Nguyen was tired out, but that Mr. Nguyen was still swinging the grill around.

Officer Olivere arrived on scene at 10:54 a.m. The apartment manager, J.T. Babin (972-822-5073) was on the scene and knew where Mr. Nguyen lived; which was apartment 3906. At 10:57 a.m. Officer Blessing arrived. At 10:58 a.m. Officer Olivere advised dispatch that he was out with Mr. Nguyen on the back patio outside of apartment 4704.

Tenant Demetra Mitchell told Officer Blessing she was in her apartment across from where Mr. Nguyen was trying to get into another apartment. Ms. Mitchell said she heard Mr. Nguyen yelling for help. Ms. Mitchell saw Mr. Nguyen grab a mop and watched as Mr. Nguyen began hitting the brick pillar with that mop. Ms. Mitchell then saw Mr. Nguyen grab a barbeque grill that was in front of the patio and watched as Mr. Nguyen began slinging that grill around, throwing it into the back patio door. Ms. Mitchell watched as Mr. Nguyen began hitting himself with the grill, while screaming that someone was trying to shoot him. 

Ms. Mitchell watched as Mr. Nguyen ran and threw himself against the glass patio door and stayed there until the police officers arrived.

Tenant Adam Grier told Officer Blessing he was inside of his apartment when Mr. Nguyen suddenly ran into his apartment; yelling for help and saying that someone was trying to shoot him. Mr. Grier asked Mr. Nguyen if he wanted him to call 9-1-1 for him. Mr. Nguyen then ran back out of his apartment, yelling.

Tenant Anezo Ekangaki told Officer Blessing he had seen Mr. Nguyen running and yelling, They are chasing me and trying to shoot me. Mr. Ekangaki watched as Mr. Nguyen jumped on top of a white Lexus that was parked in the parking lot and saw Mr. Nguyen began jumping up and down on the roof of that car, yelling for help.

Officer Blessing located a white Lexus parked by building 39. The roof of that car (which was later learned to belong to Mr. Nguyen) was damaged from Mr. Nguyen jumping on it.
 
At 11:00 a.m. Officer Olivere advised dispatch that Mr. Nguyen was complaining of chest pains and called for EMS. At 11:01 a.m. a Grand Prairie Fire Department ambulance and Fire Department Engine were dispatched to respond to that location. The ambulance arrived at 11:04 a.m. and the Engine arrived at 11:08 a.m.

When Officers Olivere and Blessing came into contact with Mr. Nguyen they found him at the back patio of apartment 4704. Mr. Nguyen was crouching on the balls of his feet, was wearing only a tank top and boxers and was yelling ""Help, he is going to shoot me, pointing to the wall behind him.

At that point Mr. Nguyen began getting irate, swinging his arms and bobbing his head back and forth
continuously. The officers told Mr. Nguyen that medics were on their way and asked him to stay calm. Mr. Nguyen was only getting more irate and trying to stand up. Each time Mr. Nguyen would stand up, he would lose his balance and fall back to a crouching or seated position. Mr. Nguyen kept telling the officers, They are trying to shoot me, help, while pointing to an imaginary person.

Mr. Nguyen then began using his elbow to hit the glass patio door. Officer Olivere told Mr. Nguyen to stop, but he continued to hit the glass door with his elbow. In order to try and prevent Mr. Nguyen from injuring himself, Officer Olivere and Officer Blessing temporarily placed Mr. Nguyen in handcuffs while waiting on the arrival of EMS Mr. Nguyen continued to struggle with both officers, continuing to say, ""He is going to shoot me,"" as the officers were handcuffing Mr. Nguyen. 

After Mr. Nguyen had been handcuffed, the officers sat him in a sitting position on the patio. Once he had been handcuffed, Mr. Nguyen began rocking back and forth until he fell over. While he was handcuffed Mr. Nguyen began running around in circles while on the ground.

At that point Mr. Nguyen began trying to get up. Officer Olivere placed his hands on Mr. Nguyen, trying to gently hold him down and to keep Mr. Nguyen from getting up. Mr. Nguyen started flinging his legs and making his body go in a circle on the patio while Officer Olivere was trying to hold Mr. Nguyen down. Officer Olivere continued to try to keep Mr. Nguyen on his side so Mr. Nguyen would not be lying on his stomach. The officers continued to try to reassure Mr. Nguyen that he was going to be okay, letting him know that medics were on their way and the police would not let anyone shoot him.

The medics arrived and began attending to Mr. Nguyen by putting a blood pressure cuff on his arm to check his vitals prior to placing Mr. Nguyen in soft restraints. Suddenly Mr. Nguyen stopped breathing. Medics immediately began to perform CPR on Mr. Nguyen. EMS then transported Mr. Nguyen to the Arlington Memorial Hospital in full cardiac arrest. At 11:51 a.m. Mr. Nguyen was pronounced dead at Arlington Memorial Hospital by Dr. Lawrence Gayao.

After Mr. Nguyen had been taken to the Hospital, Officers Olivere and Blessing were allowed into Mr. Nguyens apartment by apartment management. They found the front door to Mr. Nguyens apartment to be locked from the inside. Apartment management then managed to open the garage door and the officers were able to make entry into Mr. Nguyens apartment. Once inside of Mr. Nguyens apartment, the officers saw that items had been thrown around in the living room and bedroom. The officers noticed that the back patio sliding glass door on Mr. Nguyens second floor apartment was wide open. Inside of Mr. Nguyens apartment the officers found a Play Station game on the living room near a Play Station gaming console. The controllers were in the floor of
the living room.

Field I.D. tech Officer Brandy Elliott responded to Arlington Memorial Hospital where she took 13 photographs of Mr. Nguyens body. It was clear from those photos that Mr. Nguyen suffered a few minor injuries whenever he jumped off of his second floor balcony and burnt charcoal powder can been seen on the bottoms of Mr. Nguyens feet.

Crime Scene Supervisor April Stoll responded to the Towns of Riverside apartment complex where she took 45 photographs of the scene at 2803 Riverside Parkway. Those crime scene photos include photos of Mr. Nguyens apartment, photos of the damage Mr. Nguyen caused to the roof of his Lexus, photos of the red barbeque grill and the damage caused to that red grill by Mr. Nguyen while he was hitting himself and the back door of another apartment with that grill and photos of the back patio area of the apartment where Mr. Nguyen was hitting the back door when first contacted by Officer Olivere.

Major Crimes Unit Detective Hinson spoke to Mr. Nguyens live-in girlfriend (Thanh Nguyen) and she told the detective she has known Mr. Nguyen for about three years as they are both originally from New Orleans. Ms. Nguyen said she and Mr. Nguyen had only been dating and living together for about two months. Detective Hinson also spoke to Mr. Nguyens friend, Sang Chan who said he knew Mr. Nguyen to use Cocaine and to drink a lot of beer. Mr. Chan also told Detective Hinson he had not seen Mr. Nguyen in a couple of days. Notification was made to the next of kin by Detective Hinson.

The Tarrant County Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy on Mr. Nguyen is Dr. Lloyd White. Dr. White advised Sergeant Alan Patton that Mr. Nguyen was ""loaded with a massive amount of
raw cocaine.""",ab,wd,1,,,

Officer Wheeler observed the man, Curtis M. Harwell, to come out of the apartment. Officer Wheeler ordered Harwell to come down some stairs and to lie on the ground. 

Harwell complied with the officers commands and he was handcuffed. An ambulance was called for Harwell due to the fact that he had cuts and scrapes on his body from breaking into the apartment. Harwell started telling Officer Wheeler and Officer Summers that he had to get out of there because people were after him. 

The officers told Harwell to relax and put him in a sitting position on the sidewalk. Harwell tried to get up from his sitting position and got on his knees and the officers told him to sit down and relax, but he continued to try to get up. 

Officers tried to get Harwell back on the ground and Harwell started kicking and tried to pull away from the officers. Harwell was placed back on the ground and one officer held his legs and another officer was on Harwells torso. Harwell grabbed an officers flashlight that had fallen to the ground and the officer had to pull the flashlight free, and as he did this, Harwell grabbed the officers wrist and would not let go. The officer then used his flashlight to strike harwell in the hand to make him let loose of his wrist. 

Harwell then attempted to get up off the ground as the officers tried to hold him down. Harwell was sprayed with pepper spray, but it had no effect on him. Harwell then grabbed hold of Officer Wheelers finger and bent it. Harwell was given several commands to release the finger but he refused. Officer Wheeler struck Harwell several times in the Common Peronial and Wheeler was giving commands to Harwell to make him let go of the finger. Officer Summers was able to get his finger and hand free of Harwells hold. The officers then secured Harwell on his stomach on the ground. After a few seconds, Harwell became still. Officers asked Harwell several questions but got no response. 

Officer Crockett then walked up and could see that Harwells lips were blue. Harwell was turned over and CPR was started. Garland Fire Department Paramedics arrived on scene shortly after and took Harwell to Mesquite Community Hospital where he was pronounced dead.",tp,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/b5ec3a3a06ac4c308f55a809e6f6d2b9.jpg,"34,50,387,469"

Officer Clark asked Lopez to stop kicking the paramedic but Lopez did not respond to the verbal command. Officer Clark displayed his taser, sparked the taser and warned Lopez that he would use the taser on him. Lopez did not respond to the display of the taser. Officer Clark used the taser to drive-stun Lopez twice. The drive-stun had no effect on Lopez. MedStar personnel used a chemical restraint and rapid sequence intubation, in order to calm Lopez and transport him to the emergency for treatment. 

Lopez lapsed into a comma while in John Peter Smith Hospital and died on August 23, 2006. The Tarrant County Medical Examiners Office determined the death was accidental due to acute cocaine intoxication.",ed,,,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/c6773782047c44698a9b1fd06d256386.jpg,"62,6,438,452"

Charlotte Jacobs called the Police and stated that her MHMR 24 year old son was off of his medication and was causing problems. She described him to be a black male wearing no shirt, and blue jeans. She requested that Medstar Ambulance service take him to John Peter Smith Hospital to the Psychiatric Treatment Ward. Three uniformed Fort Worth Police officers had arrived by 1047hrs.
Michael Jacobs was standing in the front yard at 6266 Ava Court Drive, with no shirt on. His chest was covered in deodorant and he was sweating profusely. The weather outside was 62 degrees. He was delirious and was hallucinating, describing people and objects that were not there. Officers reported that Michael Jacobs was very agitated, and was pacing in the yard. He was talking to himself
and cursing. While Officers were trying to calm Michael down, they spoke with Charlotte Jacobs on the front porch. She advised that she had called the police to report her son had a physical altercation with his father, and that he needed to be taken to John Peter Smith Hospital again, since he was acting aggressive and was not taking his medication. Charlotte Jacobs reported that her son Michael had been awake for 3 days straight and that he was not acting normal at breakfast. The day before this incident Michael came home and she suspected that he was under the influence of some sort of drug. She stated that he was agitated all day, that he didnt sleep the night before, and that he talked out loud all night in his room, as if someone was in the room with him. Michael refused to be taken anywhere and refused the officers requests to calm down and be transported to the hospital. The officers needed to gain compliance to arrest him for a Mental Detention, for an evaluation at John Peter Smith Hospital. Officers were arresting Michael Jacobs for Mental Application Detention. Officers described Michael as being very lean, fit, and muscular. Michael repeatedly told officers that he wasnt going to John Peter Smith Hospital and they were going to have to fight him. One officer un-holstered her Taser and warned Michael, several times, that if he didnt come with them to the hospital, she was going to have to tase him. Michael continued being uncooperative and refused, responding I aint going anywhere, so go ahead and tase me, Ive never felt that before. At this point officers described that Michael was tensing his arms, and balling his hands into fists. He then got into a fighting stance. To prevent injuries to the officers on the scene and gain compliance from Michael, the Taser was deployed, and the probes struck Michael in the pectoralis and lower chest area.
Officers gave Michael repeated verbal commands to put his arms behind his back. Michael never complied. At the end of the cycle, officers continued commanding Michael to put his hands behind his back. Instead, he began to lift up off the ground with his hands, as if to try to stand onto his feet. The probes were still connected to Michael, and a second cycle was activated. After this cycle, officers were able to pull Michaels arms out from underneath and handcuffed him. Michael was immediately rolled over, and the officers sat him on the ground with his back leaning on one of the officers legs. At this point, Michael was observed taking several heavy breaths. His eyes then closed, followed by gradual shallow breaths. Drool was also observed coming from the corner of his mouth. One officer checked and observed that Michaels eyes were dilated.

When officers arrived they located a subject wearing only boxer shorts and socks. The subject appeared to be high on some type of illegal drug due to his aggressive and threatening demeanor and incoherent statements.

Due to that fact, responding officers requested additional back-up and a supervisor with a Taser. During the encounter with the subject, later identified as Kevin Ray Omas, W/M, 08-25-87, officers attempted to control him by talking to him and giving him verbal commands to lie on the ground so he could be safely approached and controlled. Omas would comply but as soon as officers would approach him he would jump up and challenge officers. 

Omas is 6'2"" tall and weight 250 pounds. Omas continued to refuse to comply with officers commands to stay on the ground. Upon the arrival of a supervisor, Omas continued to refuse to comply with demands even after being told the Taser would be used. 

He charged the supervisor armed with the Taser who was able to sidestep him the first
two times, but the third time Omas charged he grabbed for the supervisor who deployed the Taser striking Omas with both darts. This action caused Omas to fall to the ground. Officers were unable at this time to take control of him. Omas again regained his feet at which time he was hit with a second stun from the Taser.

Omas again got up and attempted to charge officers at which time he was hit with a third stun. Officers then moved in and took control of Omas. It took all officers on scene to take physical control of Omas and place him in handcuffs.

While in custody Omas was provided with medical treatment by Euless Fire Department Paramedics and transported to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth where he was released to medical personnel. It was learned that Omas had consumed at least three hits of LSD, and had also taken Ecstasy, Valium, and Hydrocodine prior to his encounter with the police.

Due to the amount and type of drugs in his system, Omas was in critical condition in the hospital and on Tuesday, July 12, 2005 he was pronounced dead.

A Bordens Security Officer stated that an unidentified black male approached the gate of the business and stated that someone was trying to kill him. The suspect was behaving and speaking irrationally, so the Security Officer called 9-1-1 and requested a patrol element and an ambulance. 

Officers Wilburn and Goetz arrived at the location at approximately 2:08 a.m. A Dallas Fire Rescue Ambulance was already at the location. The Bordens security officers were holding Mr. Paris on the ground. The security officers told Officers Wilburn and Goetz that the suspect repeatedly stated that someone was chasing him and trying to kill him. 

Mr. Paris had attempted to jump the fence into the business property. Officers Wilburn and Goetz then handcuffed the suspect and with the security officers assistance, attempted to lift the suspect up from the ground into the ambulance. 

The suspect continued to resist the officers efforts by pulling away and kicking his feet, causing everyone to fall down to the ground. The suspect landed on his stomach, on top of Officer Goetz and one of the security officers. The officers got out from underneath Mr. Paris while the suspect remained momentarily face down on the ground. The suspect was then lifted off the ground and placed on the gurney.

Officer Sanchez struck Suspect Moreno several times in the face in an attempt to make him release the pepper spray, which he finally did. Officer Sanchez then deployed a burst of pepper spray to Suspect Morenos face. 

When Officer Jeffrey Debevec, #9672, arrived at the location, the passerby disengaged himself from Suspect Moreno (who was still combative), and left the location. Officers Debevec and Sanchez applied knee strikes to Suspect Moreno several times in an effort to gain his compliance and get him handcuffed. 

Officer Ryan Hales, #9820, arrived and assisted by placing his knee on Suspect Morenos left shoulder. Officer Francisco Nevarez, #9347, arrived at the location and assisted by gaining control of Suspect Morenos legs and placing flex-cuffs on his ankles. Throughout the altercation Officers Sanchez and Debevec were giving Suspect Moreno loud verbal commands for him to calm down and put his hands behind his back. 

After Suspect Moreno was handcuffed, the officers noticed his breathing was shallow, turned him over and observed his lips were blue. Dallas Fire and Rescue responded and transported him to Baylor Hospital, where he was pronounced deceased.

The officers approached Suspect Young, asked him if he lived in the apartment complex, and he responded by cursing at the officers and waving his arms franticly. Officer Martinez attempted to grab one of Suspect Youngs arms, but he jerked away. At that point, Officers Martinez and Sansom took Suspect Young to the ground and attempted to handcuff him for their safety, but he continued to violently struggle and kicked Officer Sansom several times in the leg. 

Both Officers Martinez and Sansom were giving Suspect Young loud verbal commands to stop resisting, but he did not comply. Officer Martinez applied a one second burst of OC spray to Suspect Youngs face, but it had no effect. As Officer Sansom broadcast an assist officer over the police radio, he observed Suspect Young stand up, defeating their attempts to gain control of him.

The comments on the call gave a description of the suspect and stated he was walking down Westmoreland. As Officers Neal and Lozano approached the call they observed the Suspect Locket, who was dressed only in a pair of shorts, and ordered him to stop. Officer Lozano patted him down for officers safety and had him sit on the curb. Suspect Locket got up and began yelling, Satan I rebuke you! 

Suspect Locket then began walking away and the officers gave him verbal commands to stop. Officer Lozano then tased suspect Locket, which had no effect. Suspect Locket pulled the barbs out of his chest and ran west bound on Hansboro. 

Suspect Locket then ran several blocks to a residence at 2837 Spruce Valley Lane, where he jumped onto burglar bars that were attached to the front door, and tried to gain entry. Suspect Locket then jumped off the burglar bars and informed the officers he was on wet (wet is a street term for PCP). 

Officer Neal requested additional cover elements and DFR to their location. Suspect Locket began approaching Officers Neal and Lozano forcing them to back up and maintain their distance. Suspect Locket then started smashing his head on the metal mailbox, knocking it out of its concrete base and causing it to fall to the ground. 

Suspect Locket again approached the officers, and came within five feet of them, when Officer Neal discharged his taser, again having no effect. Suspect Locket tore the barbs from his chest and ran several houses over and attempted to climb a wooden fence. Suspect Locket ran back down Hansboro, grabbed a shoe out of the bed of a parked pickup truck and began beating the ground with it. 

During this entire incident the officers were attempting to give the Suspect Locket ample space and yelling loud verbal commands for him to stop. Officer Mark Herrera, #9166, responding to the request for cover, approached the scene on Hansboro. Officer Herrera exited his vehicle, and was instructed by the officers to form a line to avoid a crossfire situation. 

Officer Herrera approached the officers, leaving his vehicle running in the street, and formed a line with the other officers. Suspect Locket ran to Officer Herreras vehicle, jumped in and attempted to drive away. Officer Herrera tased suspect Locket as he attempted to drive away in the police vehicle. During this time several other officers extracted Suspect Locket from the vehicle and attempted to handcuff him. Suspect Locket resisted the officers and tried to take a baton from Officer Olegario Garcia, #9113. Officer Garcia struck him with his baton. 

Suspect Locket continued to resist, and Officer Brett Rosen, #9783, tased the suspect, causing him to fall to the ground. The officers were still struggling to gain control of the suspect and he began to get up again. Officer Rosen delivered another discharge from his taser, and the suspect fell to the ground. 

At some point during the ground struggle with the suspect, Officer Jeffrey McAvoy, #9153, applied an arm bar, and held the suspects torso until he was handcuffed. Officer McAvoy stated he continuously gave loud verbal commands for the suspect to relax and take deep breaths. Suspect Locket was handcuffed, but continued to kick his feet. Officer Lozano struck suspect Locket twice on his lower legs with his baton to keep him from kicking.

 Flex cuffs were placed on the suspects legs and he was put in the ambulance where paramedics began treating him. Suspect Locket was breathing and talking when placed in the ambulance. He was transported by DFR to Methodist Central where he was pronounced deceased at 1:05 a.m. 

The original call came out as a Theft in Progress. 

However, after speaking with the complainant, he informed the officers that he was struck several times in the face. This punching in the face caused the offense to actually be classified as a Robbery of an Individual. This offense has been documented on service #255819-X.

At that time Officers Pacheco, Pomponio and Runyan began wrestling with the suspect in an attempt to take him into custody. The suspect grabbed Officer Runyans taser, which was still holstered, and pulled the entire apparatus off his Sam-brown. The holstered taser fell to the ground followed by the suspect and all three officers. The suspect pulled the holstered taser close to his chest and attempted to remove the taser from its holster.

http://electronicvillage.blogspot.com/2009/11/taser-death-unidentified-man-corpus.html


C-T: A lawsuit against five police officers in connection with the 2009 death of a bicyclist who was stunned with a Taser and pepper-sprayed has been dismissed.

 U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales-Ramos issued the ruling Thursday against the estate of Herman George Knabe, 58, a South Carolina man who died in November 2009.

The officers were placed on administrative leave after Knabe died in police custody and later were placed back on duty after an investigation.



An officer tried to stop Knabe about 6:54 p.m. Nov. 11, 2009, after he reportedly was seen swerving his bicycle into traffic along Airline Road, police said. He also was seen banging on a restaurant window and speaking unintelligibly, police said. Police said Knabe resisted when an officer tried to frisk and handcuff him, and more officers were called to the scene. It took five officers to detain him after the use of two Tasers and pepper spray failed to subdue him, police said.

Knabe stopped breathing while in custody and an officer performed CPR on him, police said.

He died two days later at a Corpus Christi hospital after being removed from life support. After an exhaustive search, his relatives were located in Fort Worth and South Carolina. They sued the city, claiming excessive force on the part of the officers.


***Need autopsy/discipline","On 11/11/09, at approximately 18oo hours, Mr. Knabe was riding his bicycle on the 2500 block of Airline, swerving into on coming traffic. Mr. Knabe was then contacted by a CCPD Officer, requesting that Mr. Knabe move out of traffic.

 After being given visual and audible signals, Mr. Knabe refused and proceeded to the 6300 block of Wooldridge. The officer then attempted to pat down Mr. Knabe, in which at that time Mr. Knabe began to resist. 

Other officers then arrived on the scene to assist and continued to struggle with Knabe. Knabe was then tased but only one probe was able to make contact. Knabe was then pepper sprayed to gain compliance. At that time officers noticed that Knabe was no longer moving. When checking on Knabe, officers noticed that he was not breathing. EMS was called and CPR was administered until medics arrived. Knabe was then transported to Spohn South. CCPD was then notified that Knabe was in critical condition. Medical results then revealed that Knabe was brain dead. Knabe then passed away on 11/13/09, 15:00pm, after assisted

Police cleared in man's death

Jurors reject allegations of excess force

Jurors decided Thursday that officers did not use excessive force during the September 2005 arrest of a man who died in police custody.

A lawsuit filed by the family of Gilberto Limon alleged police violated his civil rights by using unnecessary force and accused the city of being responsible for his death. The jury trial was held this week in U.S. District Judge Hayden Head's court.

Corpus Christi police officers Albert Villarreal and Jesus Cruz were dispatched to MacArthur Street on Sept. 19, 2005, after several residents called to report a man pounding on their doors.

When the officers arrived, they found Limon yelling and kicking a door of a home that wasn't his. According to police reports, Limon became violent after the officers tried to frisk him for weapons. They pepper-sprayed him and when he continued to resist, Villarreal struck Limon's legs with a baton.

Limon, 42, later went into cardiac arrest and was taken to Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, where he was pronounced dead.

An internal investigation cleared the officers of any wrongdoing in the incident.

The suit, filed in October 2006, claimed that Limon hadn't posed a threat that day and that officers failed to see he was in need of medical help. The suit asked for an unspecified amount of damages including Limon's funeral and burial expenses.

The Nueces County Medical Examiner ruled his death was caused by cocaine-induced delirium. Police Chief Bryan Smith said the officers made every effort to help Limon, but also had a duty to protect the neighborhood.

Christopher J. Gale, the family's attorney, said jurors made the wrong decision but his clients haven't decided whether to appeal.

Attorney Jim McKibben, who represented the city, said that while Limon's death was unfortunate, the officers were not at fault.

""I think the officers acted properly and the jury believed that, too,"" he said.

An officer arrived at the location and found an individual identified as Rodolfo Cisneros Jr., lying in the middle of the street. The officer was able to get Mr. Cisneros to his feet and walk him to a safe location. In interviewing Mr. Cisneros, officers observed several scratches on his arms, unsteady balance, slurred speech, dilated pupils and he was sweating profusely. 

While the officers were talking to him, Mr. Cisneros suddenly attempted to reach into his pants pocket. The officers reacted to this sudden movement and attempted to place him under arrest. After a brief struggle, the officers managed to gain control of Mr. Cisneros who was physically resisting them. He was escorted to a patrol unit whereupon he continued to be resistant. On arrival at the patrol unit and attempting to search Mr. Cisneros, he attempted to kick the officers.

 Mr. Cisneros was placed in the back of the patrol unit and began to be transported to the Brownsville Police Department Municipal Jail. While enroute, Mr. Cisneros attempted to kick out a window to the patrol unit. This caused a police officer to ride in the back of the unit for Mr. Cisneros safety and to prevent property damage. He still continued to be combative attempting to kick and spit on the officer riding in the back with him however was not successful. 

At about 5:52 pm, police officers arrived at the Brownsville Police Department Municipal Jail with Mr. Cisneros being placed in cell 114 (padded) for his safety. Shortly thereafter, Emergency Medical Services was summoned to evaluate his condition. As a result of this, Mr. Cisneros was transported to Valley Baptist Medical Center for further evaluation and clearance. Doctor Fehr was the attending physician who advised officers at location that the toxicology test showed positive for cocaine. Mr. Cisneros next of kin was notified and advised that she needed to respond to the hospital as he was in critical medical condition.

On June 8, 2008 at 6:40 am, Mr. Cisneros died while at Valley Baptist Medical Center. Justice of the Peace Linda Salazar authorized a complete autopsy be conducted on Mr. Cisneros. The preliminary autopsy report indicates, Cause of Death: Pending further studies; Manner: Pending; and Conclusion: The final report is pending toxicology and medical reports. There is no significant life threatening trauma to the body. 

Further criminal investigation has revealed that Mr. Cisneros and an accomplice were using crack cocaine for three days prior to his death. The supplier of the crack cocaine has been identified as Jerry Garza DOB 03-26-1985. A subsequent narcotics investigation with Mr. Garza being the focus of the investigation has resulted in his arrest on June 15, 2008 for Possession of a Controlled Substance with Intent to Deliver Cocaine 4.3 grams, Delivery of Controlled Substance Cocaine 2.0 grams, and Resisting Arrest.",js,ip,5,,custody_deaths/images/deaths/fca9d42d049949ae8bcf83577cc00e3d.jpg,"95,7,460,440"

Clark was placed in the enclosed area of the back seat while officers attempted to determine what witnesses were available to shed light on the situation. After speaking with a number of persons it appeared that Clark had become enraged with a female acquaintance and took her truck keys when she had stopped momentarily on William Cannon Drive. Based upon the bizarre behavior, a mental health officer was called to the scene. Officers obtained a telephone number for Clarks wife, Germonica Roland, and they called her to ask for assistance in making a determination as to why Clark was acting as he was. She offered no explanation. Michael Clark began to become more agitated and Officers asked him to cooperate in having cuffs placed on him. Clark made it clear that he had no intention of letting cuffs be placed on him and intended to fight any attempts. Additional officers and supervisors were requested to remove Clark from the car and place handcuffs on him.

Eight officers/supervisors were present when Clark was pepper sprayed but still refused to cooperate and fought attempts when officers tried to open the car door. EMS was requested to come to the scene. He was then darted with a taser and officers began to pull him from the vehicle. Clark was darted a second time after he jerked out the first taser barbs as they were obviously ineffective. He continued n a violent struggle with officers for over 3 _ minutes before he was cuffed and began to lessen his struggle. Several officers were injured with scrapes, bruises, abrasions, inadvertent taser contact and one human bite. EMS arrived and transported Clark to South Austin Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The Officers made contact with the sole occupant of a green Infinity passenger car at 1572 Mahogany Drive, Allen, Collin County, Texas. The subject was later identified as Edgar Vera (White/Male; Date of Birth 03/22/1960, TXDL# 17140673).

Officer Gilmore #4172 relayed the information to Vera who advised that he was at the location visiting his cousin, however Officer Ruatta #4167 went to the address indicated by the defendant (1572 Mahogany Dr.) 

And there was no answer at the door. Officer Gilmore attempted to affect the arrest, however Vera began actively resisting by pulling his arm from Officer Gilmores grasp and then by physically fighting with the Officer. Officer Ruatta assisted Officer Gilmore and began giving verbal commands
that Vera failed to obey. Vera was decentralized to the ground and OC pepper spray was dispensed on Veras facial area; however it was ineffective and Vera continued to physically struggle and fight with the Officers.

Other officers responded to the scene in an effort to affect the arrest, per their accounts. Vera was lying on the ground on his stomach. Officer then noticed that Vera was no longer struggling, so they turned him over on his back and began to administer CPR (Cardiac Pulmonary Resuscitation). The Allen Fire Department and McKinney Fire Department responded to the scene and Vera was transported to the Medical Center of McKinney were he was released to their custody for medical attention. Per the hospitals accounts, Vera was placed on life support upon admittance and pronounced dead on 8/19/05 at 0132 hours.
